      "<class 'str'> 296345 this was an absolutely terrible movie. don't be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside. both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece. the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. maria conchita alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. i am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like christopher walken's good name. i could barely sit through it.i have been known to fall asleep during films, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, really tired, being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot. however on this occasion i fell asleep because the film was rubbish. the plot development was constant. constantly slow and boring. things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what was causing them or why. i admit, i may have missed part of the film, but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else. i cant recommend this film at all.mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion, and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />but come on hollywood - a mountie telling the people of dawson city, yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush. mr. mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood, the canadian north for the american wild west.<br /><br />canadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm-chair and mellow for a couple of hours. wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage (as always) gently row the plot along. there are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best. a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.as others have mentioned, all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous. the plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. when men are around they want to be pursued, but when no \"men\" are around, they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. and the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). he then gets up the courage to pursue his true love.this is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in, effected by, or suffering from an eating disorder. it is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and its symptoms. the girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today, alison lohman, who was later so spectacular in 'where the truth lies'. i would recommend that this film be shown in all schools, as you will never see a better on this subject. alison lohman is absolutely outstanding, and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. if barometers tell us the air pressure, alison lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. her emotional range is so precise, each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma, on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity. mare winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as lohman's. together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another. this film is really an astonishing achievement, and director katt shea should be proud of it. the only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people. but even if you like nature films best, this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge. bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair. and if we don't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair, then we are dead inside.okay, you have:<br /><br />penelope keith as miss herringbone-tweed, b.b.e. (backbone of england.) she's killed off in the first scene - that's right, folks; this show has no backbone!<br /><br />peter o'toole as ol' colonel cricket from the first war and now the emblazered lord of the manor.<br /><br />joanna lumley as the ensweatered lady of the manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. it's alright, they have col. cricket's full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes 'round for christmas!) still, she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!)<br /><br />david mccallum as said toy-boy, equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at the circus.<br /><br />and finally:<br /><br />susan hampshire as miss polonia teacups, venerable headmistress of the venerable girls' boarding-school, serving tea in her office with a dash of deep, poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. her best bit of advice: \"i've only been to nancherrow (the local stately home of england) once. i thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, not part of the real world.\" well, we can't say they didn't warn us.<br /><br />ah, susan - time was, your character would have been running the whole show. they don't write 'em like that any more. our loss, not yours.<br /><br />so - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of \"brideshead revisited,\" right?<br /><br />wrong! they took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. after all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (you name another!)<br /><br />first warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. they get around it by shooting outdoors - \"hey, it's just the sunlight!\"<br /><br />second warning sign: leading lady cries a lot. when not crying, her eyes are moist. that's the law of romance novels: leading lady is \"dewy-eyed.\"<br /><br />henceforth, leading lady shall be known as l.l.<br /><br />third warning sign: l.l. actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. still, i'll give emily mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (i wonder . did they use contacts?)<br /><br />and lastly, fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is \"mrs.\" she's either \"miss\" or \"lady.\"<br /><br />when all was said and done, i still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why. i couldn't even tell you what was said and done.<br /><br />to sum up: they all live through world war ii without anything happening to them at all.<br /><br />ok, at the end, l.l. finds she's lost her parents to the japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. meanwhile (there's always a \"meanwhile,\") some young guy l.l. had a crush on (when, i don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by lady of the manor (must be some street if she's going to find him there.) both war casualties are whisked away to recover at nancherrow (somebody has to be \"whisked away\" somewhere in these romance stories!)<br /><br />great drama.the film is based on a genuine 1950s novel.<br /><br />journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three \"london novels\": \"absolute beginners\", \"city of spades\" and \"mr love and justice\". i have read all three. the first two are excellent. the last, perhaps an experiment that did not come off. but mcinnes's work is highly acclaimed; and rightly so. this musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of one's mind being turned into a glitzy, badly-acted, soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london, and does nothing of the sort.<br /><br />thank goodness colin mcinnes wasn't alive to witness it.i really love the sexy action and sci-fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress's that appeared in them. they found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act (remember \"candy\"?). the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough. the story here has a european sci-fi film called \"dragonfly\" being made and the director is fired. so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (jeremy davies) to complete the picture. they're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays dragonfly but she's barely in it. film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script. i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films. they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them. there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law (barbarella). gerard depardieu, giancarlo giannini and dean stockwell appear as well. i guess i'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties. if any are reading this, \"make it as sexy as you can\"! i'll be waiting!sure, this one isn't really a blockbuster, nor does it target such a position. \"dieter\" is the first name of a quite popular german musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about. it is based on the autobiography \"dieter bohlen\" wrote a few years ago but isn't meant to be accurate on that. the movie is filled with some sexual offensive content (at least for american standard) which is either amusing (not for the other \"actors\" of course) or dumb - it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a \"bohlen\"-fan or not. technically speaking there isn't much to criticize. speaking of me i find this movie to be an ok-movie.during a sleepless night, i was switching through the channels & found this embarrassment of a movie. what were they thinking?<br /><br />if this is life after \"remote control\" for kari (wuhrer) salin, no wonder she's gone nowhere.<br /><br />and why did david keith take this role? it's pathetic!<br /><br />anyway, i turned on the movie near the end, so i didn't get much of the plot. but this must've been the best part. this nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl...this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies. she calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father \"oh, i didn't expect tongue!\" great lines!<br /><br />after this, i had to see how it ended..<br /><br />well, of course, this bitch from hell has a helluva past, so the swat team is upstairs. and yes...they surround her! and yes yes! the kid blows her brains out!!!! ahahhahahaha!!<br /><br />this is must-see tv. <br /><br />cute film about three lively sisters from switzerland (often seen running about in matching outfits) who want to get their parents back together (seems mom is still carrying the torch for dad) - so they sail off to new york to stop the dad from marrying a blonde gold-digger he calls \"precious\". dad hasn't seen his daughters in ten years, they (oddly enough) don't seem to mind and think he's wonderful, and meanwhile precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother (alice brady), a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man. the sisters get the idea of pushing precious into the path of a drunken hungarian count, tricking the two gold-digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in europe. but a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good-looking ray milland, who goes along with the scheme 'cause he has a crush on sister kay.<br /><br />this film is enjoyable, light fare. barbara read as kay comes across as sweet and pretty, ray milland looks oh so young and handsome here (though, unfortunately, is given little to do), alice brady is quite good as the scheming mother - but it is deanna durbin, a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister penny, who pretty much steals the show. with absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings several songs throughout the film, though i actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this. the plot in this film is a bit silly, but nevertheless, i found the film to be entertaining and fun.this 1984 version of the dickens' classic `a christmas carol,' directed by clive donner, stars george c. scott as ebenezer scrooge. by this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it. he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially scott. one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction, ever-- was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film; but i think with his performance here, scott has now achieved that distinction. there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen scott do it; simply put, he is scrooge. and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous. it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well, to be able to make a character so real, from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face, and to make it all ring so true. it's a study in perfection.<br /><br />the other members of the cast are splendid as well, but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott's performance; and they do. frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley; a notable turn, though not as memorable, perhaps, as the one by alec guinness (as marley) in the film, `scrooge.' angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past; edward woodward, grand and boisterous, and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present; and michael carter, grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come.<br /><br />david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit, bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott's scrooge, and susannah york fares just as well as mrs. cratchit. the real gem to be found here, though, is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim; it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin, and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film.<br /><br />the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees (fred holywell, and also the narrator of the film), caroline langrishe (janet holywell), lucy gutteridge (belle), michael gough (mr. poole) and joanne whalley (fan). a flawless presentation, this version of `a christmas carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no matter how many versions you may have seen, watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever. and forever after, whenever you think of scrooge, the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c. scott. a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience, this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home. i rate this one 10/10.put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big-budget debacle: a thrash-metal updating of \"dracula\", with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker (who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway) and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore. christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the modern-day--not just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing; he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count dracula's corpse, which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van helsing's vault and flown to new orleans. this is just what new orleans needs in the 21st century! the film, well-produced but without a single original idea (except for multi-racial victims), is both repulsive and lazy, and after about an hour starts repeating itself. * from ****hilarious, evocative, confusing, brilliant film. reminds me of bunuel's l'age d'or or jodorowsky's holy mountain-- lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for..... what is it? i laughed almost the whole way through, all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre. entertaining through and through, from the beginning to the guts and poisoned entrails all the way to the end, if it was an end. i only wish i could remember every detail. it haunts me sometimes.<br /><br />honestly, though, i have only the most positive recollections of this film. as it doesn't seem to be available to take home and watch, i suppose i'll have to wait a few more years until crispin glover comes my way again with his big slide show (and subsequent \"what is it?\" screening)... i saw this film in atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash, so i was slightly dazed at the time, which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and the retards in the superhero costumes and godlike glover in his appropriate burly-q setting, scantily clad girlies rising out of the floor like a magnificent dadaist wet dream.<br /><br />is it a statement on life as we know it? of course everyone expects art to be just that. i rather think that the truth is more evident in the absences and in the negative space. what you don't tell us is what we must deduce, but is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day in and day out. rather one \"what is it?\" than 5000 movies like \"titanic\" or \"sleepless in seattle\" (shudder, gag, groan).<br /><br />thank you, mr. glover (additionally a fun man to watch on screen or at his big slide show-- smart, funny, quirky, and outrageously hot). make more films, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.it was disgusting and painful. what a waste of a cast! i swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed twice in 90 minutes. this is not a lie. do not even rent it.<br /><br />zeta jones was just too mean to be believable.<br /><br />cusack was ok. just ok. i felt sorry for him (the actor) in case people remember this mess.<br /><br />roberts was the same as she always is. charming and sweet, but with no purpose. the \"romance\" with john was completely unbelievable.this is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first lion king, but that said, this was downright good.<br /><br />my kids loved this, but that's a given, they love anything that's a cartoon. the big shock was that *i* liked it too, it was laugh out loud funny at some parts (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqué like in shrek [\"do you think he's compensating for something?\"]).<br /><br />a special note on the fart jokes, i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste. i'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in those regards.<br /><br />hmm what else? the music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but plenty of fun for the kids. no painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. a little action but nothing too scary (the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares, not sure a g rating was appropriate for that one...)<br /><br />all in all i'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that's 100% safe to let them watch (i try not to be overly sensitive but i've had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room during this one. i'd say stick around anyway though, you might find that you enjoy it too :)finally, timon and pumbaa in their own film...<br /><br />'the lion king 1 1/2: hakuna matata' is an irreverent new take on a classic tale. which classic tale, you ask? why, 'the lion king' of course!<br /><br />yep, if there's one thing that disney is never short of, it's narcissism.<br /><br />but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film. it's basically the events of 'the lion king' as told from timon and pumbaa's perspective. and it's because of this that you'll have to know the story of 'the lion king' by heart to see where they're coming from.<br /><br />anyway, at one level i was watching this and thinking \"oh my god this is so lame...\" and on another level i was having a ball. much of the humour is predictable - i mean, when pumbaa makes up two beds, a big one for himself and a small one for timon, within the first nanosecond we all know that timon is going to take the big one. but that doesn't stop it from being hilarious, which, imo, is 'hakuna matata' in a nutshell. it's not what happens, it's how.<br /><br />and a note of warning: there are also some fart jokes. seriously, did you expect anything else in a film where pumbaa takes centre stage? but as fart jokes go, these are especially good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur.<br /><br />the returning voice talent is great. i'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return, what with most of them only having two or three lines (if they're lucky). whoopi goldberg is particularly welcome.<br /><br />the music is also great. from 'digga tunnah' at the start to 'that's all i need', an adaption of 'warthog rhapsody' (a song that was cut from 'the lion king' and is frankly much improved in this incarnation), the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoever.<br /><br />in the end, timon and pumbaa are awesome characters, and while it may be argued that 'hakuna matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it. it's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with.<br /><br />am i starting to sound creepy?<br /><br />either way, 'the lion king 1 1/2' is great if you've seen 'the lion king' far too many times. especially if you are right now thinking \"don't be silly, there's no such thing as seeing 'the lion king' too many times!\"indian directors have it tough, they have to compete with movies like \"laggan\" where 11 henpecked,castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots. \"devdas\", a hapless, fedar- festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one's feelings or sentiments-alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry. but to make a good movie, you have to tight-rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum-dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit \"bollywood\" leading actor who is marginally handsome. so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words \"defending his village\" this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience. there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar (narasimhan). nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him, meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson.this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india. nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films. the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song&dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won't sell, a sad but true state of affairs. faster this changes better for \"bollywood\". all said and done this is one good movie.nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc, but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location. he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can't make a prim missionary, sarah brown, go out to dinner with him. sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store <br /><br />this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour, with big sets, loud music, larger-than-life roles and performances to match; broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing, which i don't. my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music. i like all kinds of music, from albinoni to zz top, but broadway show tunes in swing time with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea. this was written by the tag team of frank loesser, mankiewicz, jo swerling and abe burrows (based on a couple of damon runyon stories), and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak. blaine's two numbers for example are identical, unnecessary, don't advance the plot and grate on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you). there are only two memorable tunes, luck be a lady (sung by brando, not sinatra as you might expect) and sit down, you're rockin' the boat (nicely performed by kaye) but you have to sit through two hours to get to them. the movie's trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful, laid-back performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons. the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vowel-murdering of noo yawk. fans of musicals may dig this, but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show.i can still remember first seeing this on tv. i couldn't believe tvnz let it on! i had to own it! a lot of the humor will be lost on non-nz'ers, but give it a go! <br /><br />since finishing the back of the y series matt and chris have gone on to bigger and better(?) things. nz's greatest dare-devil stuntman, randy campbell has often appeared on the british tv series balls of steel. yes, he still f^@ks up all his stunts because he is too drunk.<br /><br />also the 'house band' deja voodoo have since released 2 albums, brown sabbath and back in brown. the band consists of members of the back of the y team and singles such as 'i would give you one of my beers (but i've only got 6)' and 'you weren't even born in the 80's' continue their humor.<br /><br />the south-by-southwest film festival also featured their feature length film 'the devil made me do it' which will be released early 2008 in nz.<br /><br />all up, if you don't find these guys funny then you can just f%^k off!!in a time of magic, barbarians and demons abound a diabolical tyrant named nekhron and his mother queen juliane who lives in the realm of ice and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by the king jerol but when his beautiful daughter princess teegra has been kidnapped by nekhron's goons, a warrior named larn must protect her and must defeat nekhron from taking over the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named darkwolf.<br /><br />a nicely done and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic that combines live actors with animation traced over them ( rotoscoping), it's ralph bakshi's second best movie only with \"american pop\" being number one and \"heavy traffic\" being third and \"wizards\" being fourth. it's certainly better than his \"cool world\" or \"lord of the rings\", the artwork is designed by famed artist frank farzetta and the animation has good coloring and there's also a hottie for the guys.<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere especially the new 2-disc limited edition dvd from blue underground.<br /><br />also recommended: \"the black cauldron\", \"the dark crystal\", \"conan the barbarian\", \"the wizard of oz\", \" rock & rule\", \"wizards\", \"heavy metal\", \"starchaser: legend of orin\", \"fantastic planet\", \" princess mononoke\", \" nausicca: valley of the wind\", \" conan the destroyer\", \" willow\", \" the princess bride\", \"lord of the rings ( 1978)\", \" the sword in the stone\", \" excalibur\", \" army of darkness\", \" krull\", \"dragonheart\", \" king

\"the flight of dragons\", \" hercules (disney)\", \" legend\", \" the chronicles of narnia\", \" harry potter and the goblet of fire\".a pretty memorable movie of the animals-killing-people variety, specifically similar to \"willard\" in that it stars an aging character actor (in this case, a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne, who puts in the only distinguished performance i've seen him give) in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him. yes, this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable, so that you will cheer when they die, and really the selection of actors, locations, etc. couldn't be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence.<br /><br />tremayne's character is \"snakey bender\", and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie: an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souza's music. when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend gets married to a stripper (thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert) he goes on the rampage, in the process creating a memorable pile-up of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners. one amusing game you can play while watching \"snakes\" is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff.<br /><br />all in all, very cheap and exploitative, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies.except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along. except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done. in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. eight out of ten stars.in this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! this film even goes back to before simba and (presumbably) just after the birth of kiara. <br /><br />quite true to the first film, \"lion king 1/2 (or lion king 3 in other places)\" is a funny, entertaining, exciting and surprising film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). a bundle of surprises and hilarity await for you!<br /><br />while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of \"the lion king\" they are going to start watching, as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. they have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story, which is what awaits... it starts with timon's first home...<br /><br />for anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age, enjoy \"lion king 1/2\"! :-)well, i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks. it is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family,then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie ,and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees, etc etc etc..... they go to that town which no one know it exists (blah blah blah) and the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you don't understand what is that movie!!!!i have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst, honestly it doesn't have a description at all and i wish i didn't see it.i actually had quite high hopes going into this movie, so i took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best. about 1/3 of the way through the film i simply had to give up, quite simply the movie is a mish-mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and it's all disconnected. i love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected.<br /><br />don't think it's david lynch-esquire as some would have you believe, it is nowhere near that realm other than some trippy visuals. saying it's artsy to disguise the fact there's no apparent plot or story is just a manner or justifying why you wasted the 1.5 hours in the film. the acting was good, but that cannot save lack of story. i do agree with the one comment posted previously... \"it's like being in some other person's head... while they're on drugs,\" in other words nothing makes sense.i liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem i quickly found is that one pretty much knows what's going to happen within the first 20-30 minutes ( the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody).<br /><br />there is no real twist (which is fine) , but the final reveal doesn't make a great deal of sense either (how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film, if she's an evil id from beyond the mirror?).<br /><br />admittedly the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also effectively creepy, but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script, piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite dull.my main problem with the film is that it goes on too long. other then that, it's pretty good. paul muni plays a poor chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage. luise rainer is a servant girl who gets married to muni. they live with muni's father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad. when he finally gets some money to buy some more land, a drought hits and nothing is growing. everybody stars to head north by muni stays behind at first. when they leave and arrive at town they find that their are no jobs and they are worse off than before. they even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money but decide against it. when a bunch of people start looting the town, the military show up and start executing people . paul muni does a good job and luise rainer won a second oscar for this movie.this movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it. for once, i should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. i can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />i had thought that with bloom, ledger, and rush it could have some value. all have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. it won't satisfy even that.mike brady (michael garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic \"the warriors\") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town. not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isn't that frightening, but i digress). no one will believe him at first, but they will. oh yes, they will.<br /><br />ok, killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below johnathon winters as mork's baby in the creepiness factor. so the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. the flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so bad that it's good' variety. i appreciate that they spelled out that this was slugs: the movie as opposed to slugs: the children's game or slugs: the other white meat. probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game. director juan piquer simón is more widely known for his previous films \"pod people\" (which mst3k deservedly mocked) and \"peices\" (which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made) <br /><br />eye candy: kari rose shows t&a <br /><br />my grade: d+ <br /><br />dvd extras: merely a theatrical trailer for this movie(honestly, barbra, i know it's you who's klicking all those \"no\"s on my review. 22 times?? how many people did you have to instruct to help you out here? don't you have anything better to do, like look at yourself in the mirror all day?)<br /><br />steven spielberg told barbra that this was \"the best movie i've seen since 'citizen kane'\". that pretty much says it all - and serves as a dire warning!<br /><br />what are the ingredients for a sure-fire cinematic disaster, and one that will haunt you, never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain? the ingredients: barbra streisand's face, a musical, feminism, barbra streisand's voice, barbra streisand directing, and an ultra-corny/idiotic premise.<br /><br />hollywood is full of egomaniacs, this much we know. in fact, nearly everyone  by definition  has to be an egomaniac in hollywood. why would anyone want to act? for the \"art\"?!? well, if you're dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews and streisand has the biggest ego of them all! this is quite an achievement. to be surrounded by narcissistic cretins, and yet to manage to top them all  remarkable.<br /><br />the movie, like all her \"solo\" endeavors, is an ego trip straight out of hell. every scene streisand is in is automatically ruined. stillborn. but as it that weren't enough, she sings a whole bunch of streisandy songs  you know, the kind that enabled the mariah careys, the celine dions, and the whitney hustons of this world to poison our precious air-waves for decades now. just for that she deserves not one but 100 south park episodes mocking her.<br /><br />the premise, streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi, sounds like a zany zaz comedy. apart from it being a cliché, the obvious problem is that streisand doesn't look like a woman nor does she look like a man  in fact i'm not even sure she's human. the way she looks in this movie, well it cannot be described in words. e.t. looks like a high-school jock by comparison. she looks more alien than michael jackson in the year 2015. she looks horrible.<br /><br />the songs. they made me shiver. particularly \"papa can you hear me squeel like a demented female walrus in heat?\" and \"tomorrow night i'll prepare the sequel, yentl 2: the return of the bitch\".<br /><br />did you know that streisand considered having a nose-job early on in her career, but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change? can you believe that? she should have done it! killing two flies with one swipe, that's what it would have been.<br /><br />if you're interested in reading my biographies of barbra streisand and other hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.<br /><br />should barbra streisand finally go into retirement? click \"yes\" or \"no\".the \"confidential\" part was meant to piggy-back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline congressional investigations of the day. however, despite the a-grade b-movie cast and some good script ideas, the movie plods along for some 73 minutes. it's a cheap-jack production all the way. what's needed to off-set the poor production values is some imagination, especially from uninspired director sidney salkow. a few daylight location shots, for example, would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets. a stylish helmsman like anthony mann might have done something with the thick-ear material, but salkow treats it as just another pay-day exercise. too bad that brian keith's typical low-key style doesn't work here, coming across as merely wooden and lethargic, at the same time cult figure elisha cook jr. goes over the top as a wild-eyed drunk. clearly, salkow is no actor's director. but, you've got to hand it to that saucy little number beverly garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication. too bad, she wasn't in charge. my advice-- skip it, unless you're into ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait-jacketed 50's fashion.i was thirteen years old, when i saw this movie. i expected a lot of action. since escape from new york was 16-rated in germany i entered the movie as fallback. it was so boring. afterwards i realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife. i mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access. it is more then 20 years ago, but i am still angry that i waste my time with this film. this is a soft-porno for schoolboys. undressing bo derek and painting her with color - nice. but then they should named the film undressing bo and painting her.i'm sorry, i had high hopes for this movie. unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream, i felt cheated. surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful.<br /><br />so, don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room. my kids didn't enjoy it either. ah well.a movie made for contemporary audience. the masses get to see what they want to see. action, comedy, drama and of course sensuous scenes as well. this is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family. it isn't for eyes of children. i had to fast forward quite a number of scenes.<br /><br />if it is just entertainment you are looking for, then this movie has it all. the songs are catchy. a lavish production, i must add.<br /><br />however, the message of the movie is not universal. it emphasizes on the idea of karma. that is, if you do good, you will get good. and if you do evil, you will get evil. the fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. <br /><br />in real life, this is not always true. it is well-known that most people do not get justice in this world. while it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end, there are many who escape. and then, there are many people who do good, and yet in return they meet with a sorry end.<br /><br />if you don't care about the message, and all you want is an escape from worldly reality, this movie is an entertainer alright.of the three remakes of this plot, i like them all, i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd. there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re-watchable. in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each? of course the main stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also superb. i particularly like william tracy as pepi. he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in. he appeared in many, but most are not available. as the other comments, i also say - buy this one.\"wild tigers i have known.\" it will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. it is one of those films so artsy, that it makes no sense what so ever, except to the director! i hate those! and all of those oh-so-alternative/artsy people try desperately to find \"metaphors\" in what is evident horseshit.<br /><br />there was no plot, no story, no moral, no chronology, and nothing amusing or even touching. to me, it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another, and were all for \"show\" to show how \"artsy\" and \"visual\" they could get. it was an attempt at yet another teen angst film, but missed the mark on every level humanly possible. then the credits roll! i was waiting for it to make sense! i was waiting for \"the good part.\" i own about 60 independent films in my dvd collection, many of which could arguably be called \"art house\" films. this will not be amongst them. you will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film, much less ever buying it on dvd.this is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original. this sequel isn't nearly as fun as part one, and it instead spends too much time on plot development. tim thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry. the performances are all adequate, but this time the script lets us down. the action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting, so i need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a \"trancers\" movie. unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, and so, this film is watchable at best.this is one of three 80's movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately, still overlooked. one of the others was clownhouse directed by victor salva, a movie horribly overlook due to salva's legal/sexual problems. another would be cameron's closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated--not great, but not nearly as bad as the reviews i've seen. paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think. i mean, 10 years after i've seen it and i still give it some pause, whereas something that i might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether.i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie. i guess i must have missed something. the beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories. that's the best part. after the three go their separate ways, the film splits into three threads. that's when boredom sets in. certainly, the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity. unfortunately, the director beat this one to death, even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular. bottom line: a two-hour plot-thin listlessness. if you suffer from insomnia, view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep.although the likeliness of someone focusing on this comment among the other 80+ for this movie is low, i feel that i have to say something about this one. i am not the kind of movie-watcher who pays attention to production value, thought-provoking dialog, or brilliant acting & directing. however, i claim that this movie sucks. i don't know why i don't like it... i mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie: blood, outrageousness, unintentional humor, etc. according to this evidence it should be my favorite. still, zombi 3 is a baaad movie.<br /><br />there are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen. like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water (this spoils nothing so don't worry). she walks into what i see as an abandoned hotel or something. did she not see that there was a friggin' lake in the middle of the building??? yes she's looking for water and passes up a lake. why? cuz she wants to know why the people (who aren't there cuz the place is abandoned) won't answer her when she calls out: \"is anybody there?\" oh this is just a little, insignificant piece of the big picture i'm painting.<br /><br />there is a reason, though, why i gave this film more than 1 star. it's one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is, like i have a few times, you'll want to watch it again because it's just so over-the-top in every aspect. i called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of gore. also, it has pretty weird creatures in it as well: a zombie-baby (with an adult-size hand???) and a magically flying head to name just two.<br /><br />you know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with '50's sci-fi movies? i believe that zombi 3 and movies like it should top those. it has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies battling monsters, and so on. this is the plan 9 of the '80's! while i won't say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, just expect the very worst. and when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating zombi 3, it won't be all that bad. you might actually like it, i'm not saying that's impossible.<br /><br />don't think i hate this movie, i don't... really. oh, p.s. killing birds (aka zombie 5) rules! (did i just blow my credibility?)one of the weaker carry on adventures sees sid james as the head of a crime gang stealing contraceptive pills. the fourth of the series to be hospital-based, it's possibly the least of the genre. there's a curiously flat feel throughout, with all seemingly squandered on below-par material. this is far from the late-70s nadir, but williams, james, bresslaw, maynard et al. are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability.<br /><br />most of the gags are onrunning, rather than episodic as carry ons usually are. so that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio, if you don't find the joke funny in the first place you're stuck with it for most of the film. these continuous plot strands include williams  for no good reason  worrying that he's changing sex, and kenneth cope in drag. like the stagy physical pratt falls, the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies, and lacking in cast interest. continuing this theme, matron lacks the customary pun and innuendo format, largely opting for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour. in fact, the somewhat puerile series of laboured misunderstandings and forced circumstance reminds one more of terry and june ... so it's appropriate that terry scott is present, mugging futilely throughout.<br /><br />some dialogue exchanges have a bit of the old magic, such as this between scott and cope: \"what about a little drink?\" \"oh, no, no, i never touch it.\" \"oh. cigarette then?\" \"no, i never touch them.\" \"that leaves only one thing to offer you.\" \"i never touch that either.\" that said, while a funny man in his own right (livening up the duller episodes of randall and hopkirk (deceased) no end), you do feel that cope isn't quite tapped in to the self-parodying carry on idealology and that bernard bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier. this does actually happen, in part, though only for the last fifteen minutes.<br /><br />williams attempting to seduce hattie jacques while charles hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce, but lacks the irony to carry it off. that said, williams's description of premarital relations is priceless: \"you don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room, you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first!\" \"that may be so,\" counters jacques, \"but you're not going to stick me up against a wall.\" williams really comes to life in his scenes with hattie, and you can never get bored of hearing a tin whistle whenever someone accidentally flashes their knickers.<br /><br />carry on matron is not a bad film by any means, just a crushingly bog-standard one.i was looking forward to this ride, and was horribly disappointed.<br /><br />and i am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides.<br /><br />the roller coaster part was just okay - and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride. <br /><br />it was visually dull and poorly executed. <br /><br />it was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior indiana jones and space mountain rides and disneyland, and failed in every aspect.<br /><br />it was not thrilling or exciting in the least.i really wish i could give this a negative vote, because i think i just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film. the acting was just god awful, i mean realllyyyy bad, the dialog was worse, the script sounded like it was written by.... i can't think of anything horrible enough to say. and the day \"outside\" and the night \"inside\" shots make you think the events took over several days. terribly acted, directed, written, etc etc. all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone. stay away from this one at all costs. if my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed, it is to tell the world to not watch this crap. this movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.the director sidney j. furie has created in hollow point a post-modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. <br /><br />sidney j. furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterisation' when you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason'. <br /><br />the result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher.<br /><br />one and a half stars.<br /><br />p.s. nothing in this movie makes any sense, the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane.luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth. unfortunately, her role required no. she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). set in ancient asia, both actors were not asian, but were very convincing in their roles. i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance, because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for. she must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. this seems like something that hollywood does often. al pacino has played an italian and cuban. i felt luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. she stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. if her brilliant acting was so subtle, i suppose i did not see it.i thought rachel york was fantastic as \"lucy.\" i have seen her in \"kiss me, kate\" and \"victor/victoria,\" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. she is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything!<br /><br />i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in \"lucy.\" even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy. my response to that is, \"so what?\" i wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy. i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. and rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. i also didn't want to see someone simply \"doing\" classic lucy routines. therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - vitameatavegamin and the candy factory. (it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). this approach, i thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the professor and the grape stomping, in particular. there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having. i couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally.<br /><br />i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of \"i love lucy\" throughout the entire movie. after all, those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years. i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system. in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.<br /><br />i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon. and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. \"lucy\" was a star turn for rachel york. i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. i also hope it brings her an emmy.this might be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. the writers and producers should study the german films of the thirties and forties. they knew how to sell. even soviet-style clunky leader as god-like father-figure were better done. disappointing. the loss of faith, regained in church at last second just in time for daddy to be \"saved\" by the hoover/god was not too bad. unfortunately, it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough. a few misty heavenlier shots of the angelical hoover up in the corner of the screen-beaming and nodding- would have added a lot. the best aspect is hoover only saving the deserving family and children who had \"proven\" their worth. unfortunately, other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good- yet the hoover-god doesn't help them. a better approach would have been shots of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition. finally, bright and cheerful scenes of recovery (after hoover saved the country from the depression) should have rolled at the end. we could see then how hoover-god had saved not just this deserving family, but all the truly deserving. amateurist at best.\"the plainsman\" represents the directorial prowess of cecil b. demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok (gary cooper), buffalo bill cody (james ellison), calamity jane (jean arthur), george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact, even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. truly, this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />transfer: considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. all in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road. age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. the audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />extras: forget it. it's universal! bottom line: as pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!not the most successful television project john cleese ever did, \"strange case\" has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made. there are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones, but the story as a whole unfortunately doesn't add up to much.<br /><br />arthur lowe is a hoot, though, as dr. watson, bionic bits and all. \"good lord.\"only after some contemplation did i decide i liked this movie. and after reading comments from all the other posters here, and thinking about it some more, i decided that i liked it tremendously. i love american films - probably because they are so narrative. they usually have a well-defined beginning, middle, and end. \"presque rien,\" on the other hand, makes no such attempt. i disagree with other posters that say it's 'too artsy.' in every way, this film is meant to evoke your sense memories. so often throughout the film you feel like you're there... you feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, the winter chill, the companionship, the loneliness, etc., etc.<br /><br />in every way, the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them. after i finished watching it, i felt the same. but upon some reflection, i recognized that this is how the movie had to be: the 'story' isn't the narrative, it's the emotions you (the viewer) feel.<br /><br />the lighting, scenery, and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they're rich, exquisite, and alive with detail and nuance. although i normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot (after all, isn't a movie 'supposed' to tell a story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.i just saw the movie on tv. i really enjoyed it. i like a good mystery. and this one had me guessing up to the end. sean connery did a good job. i would recomend it to a friend.i know that originally, this film was not a box office hit, but in light of recent hollywood releases (most of which have been decidedly formula-ridden, plot less, pointless, \"save-the-blonde-chick-no-matter-what\" drivel), feast of all saints, certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion. the film--like the book--loses anchoring in some of the historical background, but it depicts a uniquely american dilemma set against the uniquely horrific american institution of human enslavement, and some of its tragic (and funny, and touching) consequences.<br /><br />and worthy of singling out is the youthful robert ri'chard, cast as the leading figure, marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his 'coming of age,' only to be cruelly disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the southern plantation world of louisiana, at the apex of the antebellum period. when i saw the previews featuring the (dreaded) blond-haired ri'chard, i expected a buffoon, a fop, a caricature--i was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />ossie davis, ruby dee, the late ben vereen, pam grier, victoria rowell and even jasmine guy lend vivid imagery and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop tapestry of placage, voodoo, creole \"aristocracy,\" and haitian revolt woven into this tale of human passion, hate, love, family, and racial perplexity in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us.how disney can you get? preppy rich girls act like idiots, buy a bunch of stuff, and get taught a lesson. is disney trying to send a lesson to itself? that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human? whatever the psycho-analysis, this movie sucked.<br /><br />the girls want a rich party for their rich lives. but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes, milk) going to employ the workers. they keep it afloat until daddy comes home. and the man at the beginning, who appears to be the one that takes the money, is the one. but the ending is dumb. webcam in the cayman islands? huh? not worth my time ever again. <br /><br />but it is better than howl's moving castle. \"d-\"i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot - i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. yet i remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. i definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary \"edginess\" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.as the film begins a narrator warns us the screaming skull is so terrifying you might die of fright--and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed. well, i don't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film, but a few may have died of boredom. the screaming skull is the sort of movie that makes ed wood look good.<br /><br />very loosely based on the famous francis marion crawford story, skull is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. once installed in his home, she is tormented by a half-wit gardener, a badly executed portrait, peacocks, and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot. and to her credit, actress peggy webber screams rather well.<br /><br />unfortunately, her ability to do so is the high point of the film. the plot is pretty transparent, to say the least, and while the cast is actually okay, the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you'll be ready to run screaming yourself. true, the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes, but it all feels a lot longer. add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are.<br /><br />there are films that are so bad they are fun to watch. it is true that the screaming skull has a few howlers--but the film drags so much i couldn't work up more than an occasional giggle, and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui. if it weren't for peggy webber's way with a scream, this would be the surefire cure for insomnia. give it a miss.<br /><br />gft, amazon reviewerelegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks (at least folks who might do such a thing) sit around and talk about film noir. <br /><br />yet some of the best films of the genre, \"out of the past,\" \"the killers,\" \"in a lonely place,\" \"night and the city,\" manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows, fedoras, and femme-fatales. <br /><br />\"where the sidewalk ends,\" a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in manhattan was a rough bootleg from the amc cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classics.<br /><br />from the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass, a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective marc dixon's crumbling world, and as the moments pass, it inches ever closer, threatening suffocation. <br /><br />sure, he's that familiar \"cop with a dark past\", but dana andrews gives dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems. and yeah, he's been smacking around suspects for too long, and the newly promoted chief (karl malden, in a typically robust and commanding outing) is warning him \"for the last time.\" <br /><br />yet dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now. and boy didn't they had have it coming? <br /><br />\"hoods, dusters, mugs, gutter nickel-rats\" he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about dixon's right hook. the advice is for him to cool off for his own good. but instead he takes matters into his own hands. <br /><br />and what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts, and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before. <br /><br />right away he's in deep with the cops, the syndicate, his own partner. dixon's questionable involvement in a murder \"investigation\" threatens his job, makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in. like bogart in \"lonely place,\" can he \"escape what he is?\"<br /><br />when he has nowhere else to turn, he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the marvelous gene tierney) who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelor's existence into something worth coming home to. <br /><br />the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping. the group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss -- the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder, passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy. <br /><br />and all of this top-notch direction and acting isn't too slick or buffed to loosen the film's emotional hold. gene tierney's angelic, soft-focus beauty is used to great effect. she shows herself to be an actress of considerable range, and her gentle, kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in \"leave her to heaven.\" the scenes between tierney and andrews's dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self-destruction. <br /><br />near the end of his rope, cut, bruised, and exhausted dixon summarizes his lot: \"innocent people can get into terrible jams, too,..\" he says. \"one false move and you're in over your head.\" <br /><br />perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone -- especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right -- with one slight shift in the wind, one wrong decision or punch, or, most frighteningly, due to factors you have no control over. noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. \"where the sidewalk ends\" does so in a realistic fashion. <br /><br />(one nit-pick of an aside: this otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn't seem out of place on mystery science theater. how very odd.) <br /><br />but noir fans -- heck, any movie fans -- who haven't seen this one are in for a terrific treat.having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of bourne movies, i was a little reluctant to watch the bourne ultimatum.<br /><br />however it was a very thrilling experience and i didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films. each part of the story was easy to understand and i fell in love with the bourne ultimatum before it had reached the interval! i don't think i have ever watched such an exquisitely made, and gripping film, especially an action film. since i usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me. ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.<br /><br />matt damon was simply fantastic as his role as jason bourne. i've heard a lot about his great performances in the bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.<br /><br />the stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and i was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. well done.calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading. the genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable.<br /><br />the shop around the corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern-european atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the (also strong) nominal leads; i avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example mr. matuschek (frank morgan) has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance.<br /><br />the 1998 film you've got mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake. this is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all.the book on which this movie is based was excellent; it took a while to come to grips with houellebecq's unconventional style but once i understood the mood behind the writing i was completely drawn into the author's world of sadness. in fact, no other book has affected me so much. this is not necessarily a good thing - it elucidated my own personal struggle and has made the futility of my own struggle harder to accept. houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by harel and the hero's apathy and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed. this is a movie which reveals today's society for the lowly male in all its horror. hopefully, things will change in the future but for the present we have to accept the rat-race as shown in this movie. it's probably best that harel or houellebecq do not create a work of genius like this again. one is enough for any man.a hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer/director peter m. cohen. the story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes. we meet brad: a good-looking, wall-street playboy with a quick-wit and sharp tongue; zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; jonathan: a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and eric: the married guy, who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence. the trials and tribulations of the men's single lives in new york are amusingly expressed, mirroring that of sex in the city and hbo's new comedy the mind of married man, and bring an astute light to scamming. the story takes a twist as the three singletons meet mia--wittily played by amanda peet-and all fall for her. she seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities' they exhibit. when they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman, they chose her over their friendship. whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world, one that the critic's failed to recognize. in plain language, they missed the point. the protagonist's here are caricatures of real people. the exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satire and humility, and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic's disparagement suggests. see this movie, you'll laugh from start to finish.judging from this film and the strong man, made the same year, i would not place harry langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians. there simply is not enough there. perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously. in any event, all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of lloyd. he also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like chaplin's tramp character. his trademarks are childlike innocence, timidity of approach and a tendency to under-react to calamity by looking perplexed, batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger. the comedy in langdon's films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or naïve ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away, propping up a collapsing building with a two-by-four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him. in this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross-country walking race to publicize a rival company's footwear, he manages to win by sheer luck. there is nothing here that hasn't been done far better by the big three.i didn't expect val kilmer to make a convincing john holmes, but i found myself forgetting that it wasn't the porn legend himself. in fact, the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under-rated movie.<br /><br />as some have mentioned earlier, seek out the two-disc set and watch the \"wadd\" documentary first; it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie. <br /><br />some people seem unhappy about the lapd crime scene video being included on the dvd. there are a number of reasons that it might have been included, one of which is that john holmes' trial for the murders was the first ever in the united states where such footage was used by the prosecution. if you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; it's clearly identified as \"lapd crime scene footage\" on the menu!lisa baumer (ida galli) is the adulteress wife of a big businessman who inherits $1million life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash while on a business trip.initially she is suspected of being responsible as her husbands will had recently been changed and so she has an insurance investigator peter lynch (george hilton)and an interpol agent on her tail just to be sure. baumer travels to athens, greece to cash in her inheritance, but insists on having it in cash...a dangerous turn of events. lynch who's identity is now known to baumer tries to protect her against a lover of her husband lara florakis who nevertheless along with her henchman sharif tries to kill them both for a share of the money that she deems she is entitled to. and this is where our masked killer starts his/her brutal killings. lynch as is customary with our hero is at first suspected by the greek police and is warned not to leave athens by police inspector stavros(luigi pistilli a familiar face in giallo and spaghettis). lynch is then aided by the gorgeous cléo dupont (anita strindberg) a local journalist who helps him investigate the killings.to say any more could ruin the film for anyone who has not seen it, so suffice to say there are enough red herrings and most of them plausible to keep mystery/thriller fans happy in this story driven giallo.the no shame dvd has a superb transfer with both english and italian soundtrack. it also has a very catchy score just for good measure by bruno nicolai that will stay in your head for a while....all in all a first rate giallo.another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks, also aptly. yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non-critically and black comedy, also well worth consideration.<br /><br />watch the whole thing, all three series. at the end, all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel. the detail and intricacies are staggering. thoroughly post-modern. wickedly funny, and startlingly tragic. not for kids. not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity. thought-provoking. at once literal, figurative, and surreal in disturbing ways. the blackest comedy i can recall.<br /><br />and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see.what \"noise\" fails to do is get us to understand its character. tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer, particularly car alarms. it's an odd idea for a film, which has about as much creative credibility as \"death wish.\" it is clever at points; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel, \"i'm too stupid to be understanding this.\" he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and don't get it either.just then a car alarm goes off. throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises. though, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona. <br /><br />the film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing, and visible boom mikes. no, \"noise\" isn't all-bad. william hurt is at least colorful. at least the ending doesn't fall flat. overall it drives home a logistical point, one you haven't probably thought of. at least i hadn't. though all in all, ninety minutes long, it couldn't have ended sooner. the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.<br /><br />this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival, but probably won't get picked up for distribution. check it out on dvd if you're really partial to someone involved in the project. otherwise skip it.i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film. the humor seems to be destined for corpses. it's slow. the story is too simple to be true. the characters do not raise much sympathy, a few non-important characters aside. nothing surprising happens. what did the writers of this script think? \"oooo funny! let's make some old lady's high on pot! let's make them.... giggle! let's make them... behave like little children!! oooo, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original!\"<br /><br />this film has irritated me most from all the films i've seen in the last five years.this is a feel good film, about one person's dreams and the drive or push to realize them. it is a beautiful and inspirational film. why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out, especially the good ones. dennis quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of jim morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career. with excellent supporting cast, including brian cox, as the crusty old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son's achievements go by without his support. it was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film. if i have one complaint with this film it is this: don't ever let royce applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /><br />seriously, this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like \"field of dreams\" and \"the natural.\" it rates two thumbs up and a big \"well done.\"i had numerous problems with this film.<br /><br />it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics, which is fine. although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying: \"aren't you just blown away by this!\" well, not really. these aren't earth shattering revelations anymore. at any rate, i was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations, etc. is not new.<br /><br />the main problem i have with this movie, however, is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. i don't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics doesn't really have anything to do with these things, and it should be kept separate. the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you, hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better. the reasoning is completely ridiculous, and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory. for every so called \"expert\" that they interviewed for this film, there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree. they would point out, quite rightly, that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness.<br /><br />it disturbs me that people are going to see this film and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling. the main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments.<br /><br />avoid this film.<br /><br />oh yeah. at one point, one of the \"experts\" says that since throughout history most of the assumptions people have made about the world turned out to be false, therefore the assumptions we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false. huh? that totally does not follow. and even if it did, i don't see how that helps his argument. i mean, if his ideas ever became common assumptions then i guess we would have to assume that they are false too, based on his own reasoning.first, let's all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain lousy. however, in this piece of @*!^ called snakeeater, the film industry as a whole sank.<br /><br />first, let's start with the plot. a vietnam vet named jack kelly, aka soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some, which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor), gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. had some potential, but still pretty thin to begin with.<br /><br />now, the acting. being an actor myself, i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art!!!!! lamas is, well, himself. the jackasses playing the clampets/deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break!<br /><br />finally, the action. the gunfighting is so-so at best, and the fist-fighting is deplorable. i've seen more real-looking fights at the renaissance festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)!<br /><br />readers, listen to me: avoid this piece of caca at all costs! if it were the only film in existence, you still would want to avoid it! for the sake of your brain-cell count, do not watch this thing!corky romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific \"comedy's\" ever made.<br /><br />while the sometimes amusing chris kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious 'undercover brother' his character in corky is so stupid and so unfunny-which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea. to bad they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the script.from start to finish, i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie. it's amazing that \"the groove tube\" is possibly the granddaddy, yet raunchiest, of all comedic skit movies.this is the way i enjoy watching tv without being bored at flipping channels only to suffer from insomnia! for 73 minutes, the weird, strange humor never stops! just think of how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy life easier! it's way, way better than comedy central or any prime time show! do yourself a favor and trash all those soft, lame romantic comedy movies into the wastebasket! better yet, tell your box office manager you want \"the groove tube\" back on the big screen!what starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing. don't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the visitors, there is no ending. no explanation, no resolution, zip. this could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script.the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved. i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. i love all six of the stooges (curly, shemp, moe, larry, joe, and curly joe)! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! <br /><br />one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than husbands beware! all appearing in this short are the beautiful christine mcintyre, dee green, doris houck, alyn lockwood, johnny kascier, nancy saunders, lu leonard, maxine gates, and emil sitka. green and mcintyre provide great performances here! there are so many funny parts here. this is a very hilarious short. there is another similar three stooges short like this one called brideless groom and i recommend both!i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning. it is wonderfully thought up, and bryan fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show.<br /><br />it is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a creative, original show like pushing daisies. it is a huge relief to see a show, that is unlike the rest, where as, if you compared it to some of the newer shows, such as scrubs and house, you would see the similarities, and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity.<br /><br />with a magnificent cast, wonderful script, and hilarity in every episode, pushing daisies is, by-far, one of the most remarkable shows on your television.i just came back from the montreal premiere of zero day...and i'm surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie. basically the blame is about coccio doing an easy and overplayed social message...well, mr-i'm-a-reviewer, it's an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge.<br /><br />not that i want to expose my life here, but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go. reject & ignorance on the menu. thing is...i understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror. high schools have became battle fields of conformity. it's a real ugly sight. you need to fight your way into being like the others. it's hard to explain, bit a lot of people dosen't realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. meanwhile, parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect.<br /><br />the real motive of the movie isn't about what is driving them. it's about this death-like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town. cal expressed it well. it's a wake up call. drama is everywhere and it can take every shape. in that case little dramas(like andre being called a faggot for wearing a j.c penny shirt) are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town. andre & cal took the most extreme way to express their pain. the malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted.<br /><br />i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre & cal, like if with the pain they communicated, cal & andre have communicated their blind rage to their community, their refusal to think about the causes of some acts. <br /><br />it might seemed aggressive as a movie, but coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating. what andre & cal are living is a reality...and a scary one that might get to other kids. <br /><br />disturbing movie...home making and strong feeling made ben coccio do a very very disturbing movie.in an era of such awful cartoons, i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies.<br /><br />this movie does contradict the first. i won't deny that. however, when i was in the target age group for this movie, i didn't even notice, nor would it have mattered if i did. the people who made it may have used \"new generation\" to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began. perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began.<br /><br />this was my favorite movie at age 3-6, and it did not scare me or confuse me at all.<br /><br />no ,i'm not kidding. if they ever propose a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. i'm serious. their movies are exactly the same in every one, and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations, having a problem which they easily resolve, hoping to be popular, and getting new boyfriends. think about it. if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot, contact me and tell me its name. these \"movies\" are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries. there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters. i'm sure that when they were really young and made some o.k. movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so that now that they're, what, 17, they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studio's money. let me advise you, stay away from mary-kate and ashley! it's for your own good!i have read over 100 of the nancy drew books, and if you are not bright enough to catch on yet, nancy drew the movie was of a younger nancy drew, not the 18-year-old that doesn't go to school that all of the books are about. this was when she was sixteen. so naturally, she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade. other than that, i thought the movie was very cute. it was clean and appropriate for everyone. it was funny at times. i thought emma roberts did a great job. she was articulate, in character, and cute. i liked the awkwardness that nancy and ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books. it was a cute, pg movie that i throughly enjoyed because i, unlike most people my age, enjoy movies without sex, drugs, or profanity.an awful film! it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe. they've taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. my complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. but it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? i suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version. it's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity.i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version. everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely terrible. i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation. not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.get this film if at all possible. you will find a really good performance by barbara bach, beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house, and an unexpected virtuoso performance by  \"the unseen\". i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach, whom i'd just viewed in \"the spy who loved me.\" i love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. so: we start with a nice fresh premise. tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town, solvang, that celebrates its swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. she brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. (the late karen lamm plays bach's sister, and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to, it is just too funny watching bach (mrs. ringo starr) and lamm (mrs. dennis wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) anyway  bach's disgruntled beau follows her to solvang, as he's not done arguing with her. there's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career. the ladies arrive in solvang to do the assignment for their station, only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (maybe to bach's boyfriend, because think of it  where's he gonna stay?). the gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum, they catch the interest of proprietor mr. keller (the late sidney lassick), who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home, insisting his wife will be happy to receive them. oh no! next thing we know keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife, warning her that company's coming and threatening that she'd better play along. trouble in paradise! the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to solvang to shoot footage and interview swedes, but one of the girls doesn't feel good. bach and lamm leave her behind, wondering to themselves about mrs. keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty lelia goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. speaking of which  under-the-weather vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub, not realizing that keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. she hears him, thinks he's come to deliver linen, and calls out her thanks. lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn't get a long enough look. after he's left, poor vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent, frightening round of action) by something big that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  the unseen! lamm comes home next (bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and can't find anyone in the house. she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen, and, on hands and knees to collect it, her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting the unseen again! well, at about the time poor lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen, we do a flashback into mr. keller's past and get the full story of what his sick, sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn't smile much. bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. meanwhile, lassick has been apprised of the afternoon's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can't let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home. he tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us.<br /><br />i cannot say enough for stephen furst, whom i'd never seen before; it's obvious that he did his homework for this role, studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; bach and goldoni, each in their diverse way, just give the movie luster. not only that, but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. no stupid cheap tricks, eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners... a real treat for your collection.bromwell high is a cartoon comedy. it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as \"teachers\". my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high's satire is much closer to reality than is \"teachers\". the scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools i knew and their students. when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, i immediately recalled ......... at .......... high. a classic line: inspector: i'm here to sack one of your teachers. student: welcome to bromwell high. i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched. what a pity that it isn't!this movie is not just bad, not just corny, it is repulsive. something about daphne, about the creepy call-girl, about the whole damn (and i use the word literally) film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress. this film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having reproductive organs, and makes me feel unclean.<br /><br />one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the cliché worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish, is a truly fascinating film idea.<br /><br />thought: the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights. during the day, bright lights don't show up well, so they could go anywhere.<br /><br />count the hobgoblins: four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio, and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush-toys are killed throughout the course of the movie.<br /><br />discussion question: if you had a frigid, demanding, unappreciative girlfriend, would you enter garden-tool-combat with a military chunkhead? explain.this movie was so badly written, directed and acted that it beggars belief. it should be remade with a better script, director and casting service. the worst problem is the acting. you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, ri'chard, who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece. peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning (and keeping) couple, although both normally do fine work. the actors (and director) should not have attempted to do accents at all--they are inconsistent and unbelievable. much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english. the casting is ludicrous. why have children of an \"african\" merchant (thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable marcel, has pronounced african features, including an obviously dyed blond \"fro\"? it's as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. it's just so weird! this could be a great movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors. there are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals, daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.i really enjoyed this movie.i was fifteen when this movie came out and i could relate. this will be a movie i would show my kids to let them know, the feelings they are having are normal. it is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age..who knew that we would bounce back....again and again....great movie!!!!there are a few spoilers in this comment!!<br /><br />contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex4u and a few others, i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series.<br /><br />i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little, the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired.<br /><br />the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed. i do fail to see how that many \"professionals\" weren't able to hit a moving target, but the action was definitely there and deke, being the hero, had to survive.<br /><br />as for the comment about needing to \"get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs.\" this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of 2001, a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the u.s.<br /><br />if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it, maybe they would have realized the plot of the story: rashid, a bin laden like character, planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states. the president's man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem.<br /><br />perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it.<br /><br />as steven segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel. his best was just fodder for bored teenagers. this one tips the scales, then falls off. the characters are all cardboard. the story is double lame. i can't spoil it by telling you the ending. you already know how all steven segal movies end if you have seen one. here goes. he is a super-dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide, instead of killing him, to dope his brain until he don't remember squat. he escapes, of course, gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in afghanastan by a rogue air force pilot who, surprise, surprise, segal trained. all the heroes, except segal's character and his dusky girlfriend, die heroically and steve-baby save the whole world in one swell foop, or fell swoop. whatever. made with some surplus air force and navy flying film. and a lot of boom-booms. get some popeye cartoons instead.i first saw this as a child living in east london. the scars of hitlers luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street. i remember having nightmares after seeing it. the odd thing is, it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction. <br /><br />apart from a globally destructive war, the scale of the machines was badly awry, more nano-technology now, but overall, an excellent and well-crafted work. it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then. i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts. however, much was right. mans desire for war, mans inhumanity to man. the means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /><br />not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc, but easily the worst, never seeing the light of day. the director is not even canadian, but british, and boy does it show. we are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons. the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent, and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk. of course the british character is normal. the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say \"norm!!\"? the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes. the actors always seem to be fidgetting. are they as bored as the viewer, or is this the directors idea of cinema? avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films. a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. you won't be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes....or, more precisely, so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it! james sbardellati's \"deathstalker\" of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword & sorcery sub-genre has brought along, but it is highly amusing. the acting is terrible, the plot is pure crap, and the effects and photography couldn't be more amateurish. but it is the bad acting, the cheesy effects, and the many errors, that makes this movie so hilarious.<br /><br />- spoilers ahead -<br /><br />deathstalker (rick hill) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. one day, a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a chalice, in order to free the country from its brutal ruler, the evil king and sorcerer munkar. obtaining the sword is quite easy, but the amulet and the chalice are in munkar's possession. fortunately, the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county's most skilled warriors fight each other until death. the winner is then to take the king's place. of course, the king doesn't want anybody to take his place, an therefore he has planned to kill the winner (instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place). deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation, but also to save the old, good king's gorgeous daughter (barbi benton) from the claws of evil munkar. luckily, he doesn't get bored on his way to the tournament, since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior kaira (lana clarkson) in the meantime...<br /><br />the film has many great, incredibly stupid and funny scenes. some of my favorite scenes include: <br /><br />- deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword. the head that falls down, however, is not that guy's head. the falling head has a red goatee, while the guy beheaded by deathstalker had dark hair and no beard.<br /><br />- when the character of female warrior kaira (lana clarkson) is introduced, she is first seen in a black robe, hiding her face and body. deathstalker's traveling companion oghris (richard brooker) fights her, and during the sword fight her robe (under which she is, of course topless) opens, exposing her breasts. her breasts are the first thing we see of lana clarkson, even before her face.<br /><br />- the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the tournament, is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig.<br /><br />- evil munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest. he feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers.<br /><br />... there are many other unintentionally funny, hilarious, and great scenes. the acting is terrible but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eye-candy, and although i described this movie as 'unintentionally funny', i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is. there is a fair amount of gore, and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained. \"deathstalker\" is an incredibly awful movie, but i still highly recommend it. people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. it was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of hollywood every month.<br /><br />i saw this movie on video because i did not even know about it before i saw it at my local video store. if you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. the suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is excellent.<br /><br />this is one amazing movie!!!!! you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical. there are always stories behind stories. i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore (i studied them in school)it is very complicated. you just have to take what it gives you.....enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride....hooray!!!!are you familiar with concept of children's artwork? while it is not the greatest picasso any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more. if painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child. typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style. you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles. well, this concept of children's artwork is how i felt about fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait. while on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments. if you have seen either training day or king arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait. while foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera. sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why fuqua's name appears on so many \"best of\" film lists.<br /><br />i will never disagree with someone that fuqua's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique. his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking. i am surprised that more of hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon. even in the silly feature bait, you are witness to fuqua's greatness. two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end. in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work. alas, in the rest of this film, all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created. the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood. we have seen this two often, and no matter who you are (unless you are charlie kaufmann), you cannot recreate the wheel. it is just impossible with this genre, and it is proved with bait. i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film. i was just tired of the structure, and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it, he did not.<br /><br />then, there was the acting. while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor, i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try. i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral. i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral. again, i was disappointed. foxx was annoying. not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot. instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh. adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second. fuqua should have stopped this immediately. foxx's jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of. instead of character development, he would crack a joke. neither style worked, no joke was funny. the rest of the cast was average. by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles. they were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film. they were pawns filling in dead air space. fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.<br /><br />overall, this was a sad film. with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand. foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese. in each scene i saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues. are my words harsh? i don't think so. when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home. bait contained none of these. while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous. apparently, i took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibble.<br /><br />grade: ** out of ***** (for his two scenes that were fun to watch)i haven't watched the movie yet, but can't wait to see it! it seems very interesting and inspirational. it was one of the most interesting trailers i've ever seen: the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the \"battle within\"... thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing. this film looks so fresh and smart. and the actor is really hot. i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies, really clever. i thought that the topic selected-overcoming adversities and childhood traumas-is timeless, and god knows a lot of people need it. bring it on.carlos saura's carmen is one of the finest achievements in world, let alone spanish, cinema. it manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from bizet with powerful physical force. at the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of carmen on the choreographer/director and the principle dancers. the fine line between life and art is dazzling.why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather. titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century.with great acting,directing,effects,music and generally everything. this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. there is nothing wrong with this movie. all i can say is that this movie, not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i've ever seen. apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton. these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron's masterpiece titanic.i've seen many of guy maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. john gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. this one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake.<br /><br />as i'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review, i will mention that the actor playing \"guy maddin\" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well.my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out. we have most lines memorized. i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that dudley moore portrays. liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though i'm not her biggest fan. this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fiancée's house. his conversation with the butler and susan's father is side-spitting. the line from the butler, \"would you care to wait in the library\" followed by arthur's reply, \"yes i would, the bathroom is out of the question\", is my newmail notification on my computer. \"arthur is truly \"funny stuff\"!i enjoyed this movie,and after watching it,it made me wonder just how many 'caitlin rose's' exist in the world.how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse,and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it? just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another,because as this film demonstrates,who's right is not foremost important,its who is popular,and feared which manipulates the minds of youths,and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen.tiffani amber thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim,and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved,and his best friend.this is the kind of film that doesn't get the exposure it deserves.remarkable,and brilliant,too good to be just a film made for tv.as a physics student, i've become aware of many idiot professors, and other so-called experts, in the field. as i continue with my studies, i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on, and about the people who are doing things right.<br /><br />then, my friends tell me of this \"physics movie\" they want to see. knowing nothing of it, i'm excited, hoping that the information will be presented well.<br /><br />i've done real quantum mechanics; this wasn't it.<br /><br />this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can, and will, occur to you, if you just open your eyes. let's think about that, for just a moment.<br /><br />our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particles. that is a million billion billion billion particles! the more \"mysterious\" quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of cancelling each other out completely. as you add more and more particles into the mix, it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption, with no rationality behind it...it's just stupid.<br /><br />my friend, also in physics, and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie. but they were presented in the most misleading manner i've ever seen.<br /><br />i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie, as i have not had any kind of medical training. it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it, remembering my days in biology, but i cannot say.<br /><br />at least this film had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they actually were) scene. not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie, but the main character goes to a wedding, where she sees all different types of personalities \"driven\" by their peptides*, and then the film cuts to the dance floor, where we are spliced between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by cg peptides, and a fully cg scene, filled with dancing peptides. the film, at that point, was trying to tell us how we're \"addicted to emotions,\" so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit, \"addicted to love.\"<br /><br />this scene was redeeming, because anyone who could go through that scene, and still take this movie seriously...well, you are the ones that need to \"open your eyes.\"this is the last dutch language film paul verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream hollywood films \"basic instinct,\" \"robocop,\" and \"total recall,\" among others. he sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet gerard reve, an annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination. gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a literary club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from amsterdam. verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how gerard's imagination twists reality. asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper \"and it says 'boom' i read 'doom,' when it says 'flood' i read 'blood,' when it says 'red' i see 'dead.'\" when he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it; \"i lie the truth.\" he accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the club treasurer, a beautiful wealthy salon owner. as he gets to know her and learns her husband has died, he begins to imagine she is 'a black widow.' is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess? this is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory, i figured out is my favorite gender. looking at his body of work it is seems to be paul verhoeven's too, and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality. it's a nice change of pace from the usual hollywood fare. i saw it in 1983 and it is a film that \"stuck.\"when i had first heard of \"solar crisis\" then got a load of the cast, i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. then i saw it.<br /><br />now i know.<br /><br />for a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back.<br /><br />and the effects, while good, are pretty underwhelming; we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. but other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there's no real feel of emergency.<br /><br />don't get me started about the cast. what heston, palance, matheson, boyle, et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess. makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in hollywood....<br /><br />and as far as the end goes.... well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this. if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film, maybe i would have heard of \"solar crisis\" sooner.<br /><br />two stars. mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves. <br /><br />i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this?some people don't like the animation. personally, i think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done. there are lots of older cartoons that i just love. my problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was constructed. the characters are all just... well, goofy. and for this movie, they shouldn't be. apparently, everyone in lotr has a limping problem (for starters.) just the way they acted in general annoyed me. my two sisters and i were laughing through most of this movie. i think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones, they wouldn't have gone. i'm glad i rented this and didn't buy it. there are few movies that give me a headache. this was one of them. however, this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, although it ranks up there. or down there, depending on your view.with a minimal budget, a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination, nacho vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts i've ever seen. the subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable, since it doesn't give the ending away until the very last moment.<br /><br />don't let anybody tell you what the short is about, since you'll be able to enjoy it a lot more. nacho vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: directing, writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort i've seen in years. also pay attention to the performance of marta belenguer, her reaction shots are incredible.<br /><br />overall rating: 8/10i was not entirely impressed by this film. it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film. i'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it. it was very slow and what was with picking robocop (peter weller) as one of the main actors. that was a sad point.<br /><br />all in all i would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the catholic religion but don't expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film. it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out.our song is a marvelous example of passionate, movie making at its aesthetic best. it is, in fact, a genuine wonder of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city (crown heights, brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult, life altering choices that will likely re-define who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come.<br /><br />jim mckay's writing/direction is graceful and uncluttered. there is no sappy, gratuitous sentimentality nor are there cliché ridden solutions in this film. what we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real. there is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in our song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including american graffiti and cooley high.<br /><br />much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its principle actors. the combined presence of melisa martinez (maria), kerry washington (lanisha), and anna simpson (joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. it would be easy - and, of course, blatantly obtuse - to dismiss, as some apparently have, the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional. in fact, their quiet charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely riveting. one would have to be completely \"out of touch\" with, or completely indifferent to, the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen. likewise, the supporting cast, particularly marlene forte as lanisha's mother, compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />our song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age.let me make one thing clear.for the most part, the mentality of those who run the show in hollywood frankly p*sses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved, iconic characters from the pages of comic books. why? well let's take a typical hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall we..<br /><br />executive no.1 'hey there's lots of dollars to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days.' <br /><br />executive no.2 'good point, let's make one with haste then!  we'll do a lucky dip in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon!' (the dip takes place and a famous superheroes name is pulled out) <br /><br />executive no.1 'great! now who can we get to play the part?' <br /><br />executive no.2 'who's a big box office star at the moment?' <br /><br />executive no.1 '*name of big actor* is the in thing this week.' <br /><br />executive no.2 'but does he really suit the role? i mean he doesn't resemble the character whatsoever.' <br /><br />executive no.1 'who cares?! he's a big name; we'll make the film with him in it anyway.' <br /><br />executive no.2 'you're quite right! and besides we'll fill the entire film so chock full of glitzy special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anyway!'<br /><br />the above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons i generally loath most modern superhero movies. all style, no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads. of course to be equitable, there are exceptions to the above rule; when hollywood does get it right  take the casting of the original (and still easily the best!) superman; christopher reeve and more recently patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen in the x-men films.<br /><br />but back to the general negative traits displayed by hollywood today..wouldn't it be wonderful if our studio executives were to always choose actors who actually suited the roles? well in this less than ideal world, one filmmaker does just this believe it or not, by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts. his name is sandy collora. sadly (but typically) hollywood has not as of yet allowed collora to direct a full length film but luckily for us, he has given us tantalizing glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two (as of yet) famous super hero short features. one is the superb batman:dead end and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely fictitious film called worlds finest.<br /><br />well, let's not mince our words here  this is absolutely awesome stuff!<br /><br />the casting of mr. universe winner and male model michael o'hearn, (who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster barbarian) makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel. in fact, in terms of physical resemblance, there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic character.<br /><br />added to this clark bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the dark knight in batman:dead end; again, yet another hugely judicious piece of casting!<br /><br />what can i say?  if only this was indeed a real, full length film! hollywood studio executives  take note! this is how it should be done!<br /><br />as a final note, i am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans. tellingly, the most acerbic and vehemently adverse reactions against it clearly come once more (as similarly with batman: dead end) from a younger, less cinematically experienced audience; a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal usage of base diction. such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in hollywood, will no doubt derive great satisfaction from. after all, these very same misguided individuals are in all probability the exact same sort of cgi addicted, popcorn stuffing imbeciles that revel in the majority of crap that hollywood churns out by the deluge these days.s.i.c.k. really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself. there was absolutely no acting to speak of. the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.the budgeting of this movie was sufficient. the filming was sub sesame street. the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. if there is a book out there for this movie i'm sure it's better. i would avoid this at all costs. i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.dakota (1988) was another early lou diamond phillips starring vehicle. this film is similar to the later released film harley. there are a few differences but they're both the same. i don't know which one came first. i guess it'll remain one of the mysteries of life. but they both are troubled \"kids\" who are trying to turn there lives around. instead of bikes this one involves horses. they're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell. if you're a serious l.d.p. fan then i recommend that you watch them both. you get some extreme mugging and posturing from l.d.p. if you're game then go for it.<br /><br />not recommended, except for l.d.p. fans!!!i have no idea what people are complaining about. i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it. stone once again delivered a great character. she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct. she still has those smart but tricky answers. although sharon may be 48 years old... she looks amazing! i don't care if she's as fake as a barbie. she looks good and that's that. basic instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. sex, violence, and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it. so don't listen to them.awful! absolutely awful! no plot, no point, no end. it looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch. every day. i'm trying to give this video away but no one will take it. i'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because i like benigni. roger, i'm going to have to say thumbs down on this one.<br /><br />this charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance. marlon brando stands out. there's a subplot with mira sorvino and donald sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little. i'm still trying to figure out why charlie want to change his name. every movie with \"charles\" has been pretty bad.not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts.<br /><br />*makeup that a child can do. *acting was over done...poor directing. *editing was very choppy...many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous. *sound was badly dubbed. *music was highly inappropriate. *casting was extremely off...must have been on crack. *zombies that talk let alone...drive, dance, work...just pisses me off. *and the bad guy...holy crap! as horribly casted as he was...he was the best looking zombie of all. which doesn't say much.<br /><br />the cover art was good but very deceiving...as was the main menu of the dvd...great artwork and music.<br /><br />don\"t bother!this film is predictable; it is more predictable then a vinnie testaverdi pass, when he huts the ball for the jets. one saw the ending coming up halfway through the film. the politics reminds me when i was back east. many people know when the fix is in. i gave this four because of the acting, but the story is lame.this was in short a terrible disappointment. by far the worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels. the dialogue was horribly clumsy; i could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. the lines were delivered too hastily and felt rather out of place. they could just as well have been cited by statues. the chemistry between george c. scott and susannah york was non-existent and watching an american rochester felt strange. he could have at least tried to do a british accent. i like george c. scott as an actor, but this simply did not work. i felt like i was watching highlights from jane eyre, where the main pieces of the story had been randomly put together with no regard to the flow of the story. the scenery and music were all very nice, but i could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between jane and rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved.<br /><br />if you want to see a good version of jane eyre i suggest you watch the 1983 bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke or the 1997 version with ciarán hinds and samantha morton. now these two are brilliant adaptations.phantom of the mall is a film that fits best in the \"easily forgotten\" category. it's a pretty lousy variant on the famous story by gaston leroux, the phantom of the opera. not a bad idea to itself, but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story. on the bright side, gaston leroux doesn't has to turn over in his grave just yet. it could have been a lot worse. <br /><br />phantom of the mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and way too many boring sequences to make it memorable. also, the scriptwriters wanted to give too much draught to the story than necessary. and even though there's a lot of mystery getting build up about the character of eric ... the basic plot is ordinary and déjà-vu. ***spoilers*** it's about a young couple that brutally gets torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire. that fire was set to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home in order to make room for a huge mall to be build. the boy survived the fire and he has hidden himself in the mall to avenge himself. meanwhile he guards his girl who now works in the mall and tries to forget her loss ****end spoilers*** this pretty simple - but rather effective - plot gets thickened by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. while it should just be an entertaining horror movie, it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller...and that's not what the fans look for. there are a few innovative killings but they're not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. and besides, phantom of the mall could have used at least a bit of humor!! this entire production - the cast included - takes itself way too serious. <br /><br />i'll try to finish with a few positive aspects...like for example, it stars ken foree !! die-hard horror fans will certainly recognize him as peter for dawn of the dead! that's like the horror milestone that yet has to find an equal. even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary...it was good to see him again. tv-movie fans will also recognize morgan fairchild as the mayor, she's a fine actress and an elegant lady. pauly shore is also in this but i can't stand him...so my opinion about him may be a bit biased. and finally, a bit of praise for the leading actress named kari whitman. she's an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talent...too bad she never made it to the top. actually, this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career...if you're a a fan of either or both chuck norris & judson mills then this is the movie to see.it has a lot of adventure in it.it is a great follow up to president's man.the chemistry between the main three stars(chuck norris,judson mills,jennifer tung)is incredible.my personal opinion.this movie along with the original,has turned out so well,that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series.if you've seen president's man,i recommend this movie for you.if you've seen president's man:a line in the sand but you haven't seen president's man,then let me suggest that you do.you will not be disappointed with either one.evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth. all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances. with the tremendous cast, though, one expects stellar acting, but in this movie the expectations are exceeded. one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family. as one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind. this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it. the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack. any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles. needless to say now, but i recommend evening highly. see it you will enjoy it.frailty is a non-gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man's delusion/obsession straight into depravity. dad (we never learn his name) is a gentle man and loving father who's raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son, adam. the family's world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys' room and tells them god has given him a vision. and what a vision  the entire family's job is to destroy demons, who, of course, are disguised in human form.<br /><br />proceeding from this premise, the movie is unflinching in following it. dad kidnaps people/demons whom god has told him to destroy, binds them, lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil, then kills them  while making his young sons watch. fenton, the older boy, is horrified, seeing only a father who's turned into a crazed murderer. adam, the younger, is uncomfortable, but trusts that dad is following god's will. eventually, dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the \"demons\" that god has put on dad's list, and finally, invites them to fully participate in god's mission for the family.<br /><br />this is not, you understand, an abusive father. he loves his children. he is only following god's instructions: \"this is our job now, son. we've got to do this.\" when fenton, terrified and convinced his father has gone mad, says he'll report him to the police, his father explains, \"if you do that, son, i'll die. the angel was clear on this.\" the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic, and warps their entire lives.(1) the movie's structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects: a story in flashback, told in a police station to a fbi agent. the moody lighting, the stormy weather, and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory. i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story, until i remembered the real-life parallel of andrea yates, who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them. even then, i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy, rather than a story of divine retribution.<br /><br />the movie gave me no such comfort, though, as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dad's vision. and this, as much as some plot holes, posed a problem for me. regardless of the accuracy of dad's visions, regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed, where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death? (1) roger ebert review, 4/12/02the film gets my stamp of approval. the scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue. this is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film. dickinson's character kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film. the best work angie dickinson did since point blank!i first rented this film many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it. just recently, feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that i've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime, i decided to give \"erendira\" another look. and i'm glad i did, as i soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film.<br /><br />the story is about a teenaged girl (erendira, played remarkably by claudia o'hana - in some respects she resembles winona ryder!) who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother, played downright hypnotically by irene papas, forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages. <br /><br />the viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though, inspite of the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content. the story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which, by the way, is in the rough and tumble part of rural mexico.<br /><br />the film is very atmospheric, arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. it sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not to the point of, say, a david lynch film. it's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments from previous viewers below...<br /><br />often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion, quiet and melancholy, adding just the right musical accents to highlight the mexican setting. the cinematography of the rural places, many of which are in the desert, is quite superb.<br /><br />the film moves at a nice pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after every scene i felt i had to rewind the tape and play it over again, just because it makes you want to do that. for me anyway, it really is that compelling.<br /><br />hopefully you will see the film in its spanish language version, with subtitles. i studied spanish in high school as well as in college, and i was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. por ejemplo: \"el mundo no es tan grande como pensaba.\" (\"the world's not as big as i thought\" - i.e., it's a small world.)<br /><br />this film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which, upon drinking, is immensely satisfying, however, you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one.\"and all through the house\" is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one i saw! i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever! i had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure. this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist. \"and all through the house\" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve, which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping! well anyway you have mary ellen trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve! as from the old e.c. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!the impossible planet and the satan pit together comprise the two best episodes of the 'new' doctor who's second season. having said that, it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of quatermass and the pit (1967) to an outer space setting, with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the beast 666. these episodes cement the emotional ties between rose and the doctor, whilst also highlighting rose's increasing self-confidence, establishing her as a not-quite-equal-yet-but-getting-there partner with our beloved time lord. also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay, which decreases the occasional over-reliance on one-liners for the doctor, and the performances of the entire cast, most notably the excellent shaun parkes as acting captain zachary cross flane.i really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas l'engle brought out in her novel. we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it, i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film. there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l'engle! this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating. don't see this movie if you are a big fan of l'engle's texts because you will be sorely disappointed. however, if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as was my case) then it is an alright movie!spoiler this is a great film about a conure. he goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner. he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds. if you love birds like my wife does, this film is for you. this film also has some sad parts that make the tears run. in the end it all works out for paulie and his russian friend. rent this for the whole family, everyone will enjoy this.if the themes of the girl from missouri sound familiar it should. that's because anita loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic gentlemen prefer blondes. unlike marilyn monroe in that film, jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means.<br /><br />and it's men of means that jean harlow is after. she leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she's decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it. her talents as a chorus girl are limited, but she'll be able to trade in on that beauty.<br /><br />her odyssey starts with her and friend patsy kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire lewis stone. but unbeknownst to jean, stone's just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns. still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notices. <br /><br />lionel's amused by it until jean sets her sights on his playboy son, franchot tone. after that he is not amused and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree.<br /><br />the girl from missouri went into production mid adaption of the code so it went under peculiar censorship. i've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqué film. still jean harlow as a younger and sassier version of mae west is always appreciated. what a great comic talent that woman had, seeing the girl from missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later.<br /><br />ironically enough the casting of patsy kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde, thelma todd. harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry between that patsy had with thelma. todd would also die a year later in a freak accident/suicide/homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given. <br /><br />don't miss the girl from missouri, it's bright and sassy, must be from all that sparkling jewelry.credited by variety to be one of the greatest documentaries to ever come out of canada. al pacino, roger ebert, neil simon, matt dillon as well as a constant slew of celebs make this film a canadian classic. the film is really best described as \"roger & me\" meets \"the player\". watch as kenny hotz and spenny pitch their script to the big boys of hollywood. called the only american film to ever come out of canada, this film opened the toronto film festival in 1997, winner of the 'best indie film award toronto'. europe premier was at the prestigious hof film fest in germany. u.s.a. premier u.s. comedy festival aspen 1999. more information available at www.kennyhotz.comi mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car? so what if their ten, it's way too immature for a little kid to sing about \"being my women\" i mean seriously! the name is pretty corny too, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants??? how creative.i don't get why they need a tv show i mean most artist don't really need a tv show about themselves, especially the naked brothers band. heck how many of them are in the freaking group. and seriously whats with the movie? jeez nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously the naked brother band? so many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the naked brother's band, its a stupid, uncreative show that should not be aired onto tv.strange enough, all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over. i feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work, since marina vlady was also robert hossein's wife, and the - excellent - jazz music was written by te director's father, andré. under these circumstances, no wonder it was a really good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with the music. the suspense was flawless, and maintained throughout until the end. robert hossein, at the time one of the best european players, managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director. he's still putting up great stage shows, with a preference for religious subjects.harry carasso, paris, francei think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. i can't understand why some people say she's not. boring....??? maybe the one who said she's boring is because he/she is boring. she's a great actress and the movie was excellent. it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers. the direction was great. i imaging myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc. when she goes to the sister's shop is simply amazing. everything's great. we have a very good actress, wonderful, for long time. alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect. i like him more than in his next movie la science des rêves. and eric lartigau did a very good work.<br /><br />ana\"der todesking\" is not exactly the type of film that makes you merry jörg buttgereit's second cult monument in a row, which is actually a lot better than the infamous \"nekromantik\", exists of seven short episodes  one for each day of the week  revolving on unrelated people's suicides. in between these already very disturbing episodes, buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse. the episodes aren't all equally powerful but, as a wholesome, \"der todesking\" is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films. particularly the episodes on wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and the one of sunday, focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead, are extremely intense and devastating to observe. the added value of this film, or any other shockumenary like it, is debatable and i'm not even sure whether or not buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here. there's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically. entirely unlike i expected, \"der todesking\" isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic! on the contrary actually, i never could have hoped buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery. the thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous german bridge while the names, ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen. the production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism, but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema. the subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also indispensable  aspects of life. great use of tragic music, too!as someone else mentioned, it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat. then the main story: a photographer (gaffari) and a writer (shepard) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains. first they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at, with increasing irritation to the audience, by gaffari. once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers (hansel and gretel, anyone?) what happens next i will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because i most assuredly couldn't. now, i like eurohorror, and this woulda been better if only artigot (writer and director) had made some attempt at logical story telling. the backdrop (pyrenees?) makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences. the verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them. the photography is nice. just wish the whole thing made sense. you can view this film at archive.org.<br /><br />this movie is by far one of my favorites. i saw it while in college in the early 90's, and while i couldn't identify with the thirtysomethings in the film, i felt that the story, characters, and movie in general were top notch. to the people who spoke negatively of indian summer, feel free to stick to your overblown armageddon-type movies and leave the movies with a great, wholesome story to those who can appreciate them.this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen (spoilers ahead)! first of all, the plot is stupid. the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. we find that the kid has a gift, the \"shining\". this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool. then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because... well, he feels like it. why else would he do it? all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub. the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse, which is utterly disgusting. somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe. then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. most movies aren't a complete waste of time, but this falls right into that category. the music is trashy, the characters are corny (except jack nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring. this movie is extremely overrated. avoid this movie at all costs. i'm surprised it's gotten such a high rating on imdb.for those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline, this one is for you! from the bleak new york city atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer. <br /><br />why it won the academy award was because it was so shocking at that time that hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. so, hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. <br /><br />it also hoped, i'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. well, it succeeded on that level. audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.<br /><br />forty years ago, as a very young man, i found this film fascinating, too. however, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth i never watched to view it again. <br /><br />the acting was good, but so what? acting is good in many films. nobody ever said dustin hoffman and jon voight couldn't act. hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. he was kind of like the johnny depp of his era, playing guys like \"ratso rizzo\" in this film and then going to be the \"rain man\" later on. yes, \"ratso\" is a character you'll never forget, and \"joe buck\" (voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting.<br /><br />this movie isn't \"art,\" and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. it's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (andy warhol even gets in the act - no surprise), and generally despicable people.<br /><br />i did like the catchy song, \"everybody's talking'\" that helped make harry nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because fred neil wrote the song and sang it better, before nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of neil (which is their loss). and - as mentioned - the name \"ratso rizzo\" kind of stays with you!<br /><br />the film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, i fear: this marked it as \"official\" that hollywood had gone down the toilet, and it has remained in the sewer ever since.\"kings and queen\" is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.<br /><br />the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie. the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. the other story involves a young man named ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.<br /><br />with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, \"kings and queen\" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships. it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching. but, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. for instance, nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours. nora is admittedly no mother theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. nora could be accused of being confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? i don't think so.<br /><br />perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom. but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and co-writer/director arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. this is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.this is a total waste of money. the production is poor, the special effects are terrible. in my country they had the courage to put this film on video named as \"the mummy\" because of the success of brendan fraser`s film. i`m sure that you can find better horror movies.brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day christmas ceremonies. the voyeuristic element during the scenes (santa & pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is unique (and obviously jean-luc godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film \"pierrot le-fou\"). highly recommended!to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart. though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between scottish commoners and english nobility is front and center here as well. roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. scottland is still run by english nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. rob roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that braveheart was. there are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. and helpfully so not all englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. rob roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.<br /><br />liam neeson plays the title character rob roy macgregor. he is the leader of the macgregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the marquis of montrose (john hurt). things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. sounds fair enough, doesn't it? problems arise when two cronies of the marquis steal the money for themselves. one of them, known as archibald cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. played wonderfully by tim roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother. this man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. he rapes macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. along with another crony of the marquis (brian cox) cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the marquis still holds macgregor to the debt. this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.<br /><br />spoilers ahead!!!!!<br /><br />luckily for the macgregor's, a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. and for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. just when it looks like rob roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. the first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as cunningham! rob roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. the score is quite memorable, too. the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary macgregor. the film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. it is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. the nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy. the film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars.<br /><br />the hound.i almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways.i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked. the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station.they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy. it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be. the make-up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one. it was a simple story with believable acting.it's not the scariest or goriest movie, but i wasn't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it. on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i'm gonna check them out.\"the sweet is never as sweet without the sour.\" this quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. tom cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life. he takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. this film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.<br /><br />its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. you cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). the theme will really get you to \"open your eyes\".<br /><br />only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. i think the end is perfect though. i recommend you watch it and see for yourself.i wanted to like this movie. but it falls apart in the middle. the whole premise is a good one and ties up nicely, but the middle runs off tangent. the people i watched with were getting annoyed while it ran off course, and hoping it would end sooner than it did. another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment! i found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot. i bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well, but it lacks pixar's writing and soul. i think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride at face vaule, while missing the plot. people old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily. edit out most of the middle section, make it 50 minutes and it would be a solid flick. i wish i had better things to say. but i don't\"the invisible ray\" is part science fiction and part horror. it was also the third of seven karloff/lugosi features. in this entry the dominant role goes to boris karloff.<br /><br />through specially designed astronomical equipment, dr. janos rukh (karloff) demonstrates to colleagues dr. felix benet (bela lugosi), sir frances stevens (walter kingsford), his wife lady stevens (beulah bondi) and their nephew ronald drake (frank lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the african continent many millions of years in the past. rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to africa to find the mysterious element.<br /><br />rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names \"radium x\". due to rukh's long absences, his comely young wife diana (frances drake) becomes attracted to drake and the two fall in love. meanwhile rukh becomes contaminated by radium x to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. the contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark.<br /><br />rukh goes to benet for help. benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.<br /><br />while rukh is continuing his work, sir frances takes news of the discovery back to france. diana and ronald accompany him. when benet informs him of this action, rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. when he returns to france he learns of the healing power of radium x as he cures his mother's (violet kemble cooper) blindness and of benet's work in curing the maladies of his patients.<br /><br />but rukh's madness intensifies. first he murders an innocent man whom is identified as rukh. upon hearing of rukh's apparent demise, diana and ronald marry. this angers rukh and he begins to exact his revenge on the five other members of the expedition. one night he is lured into a trap set by benet and...........<br /><br />karloff is excellent in the lead role moving from a happily married ambitious scientist to a raving maniac. lugosi has a straight role for once and does what he can with the limited part.<br /><br />at 79 minutes this film was the second longest of the six karloff/lugosi collaborations. karloff's film all the way.i think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest. the presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work. hydrogen filled flying bladders? they would need to be the size of a mack truck to be useful. and then there's the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. i have no problem with fantasy, just don't try to pass it off as fact. some folks will always misunderstand. all in all the film is entertaining, but i constantly found myself saying \"oh brother, what a load of ....\". if you want a fake documentary, watch this is spinal tap instead. or at the very least turn the sound off.i wont take too much time here, just wanted to state that darkman 3 is awesome. i have all 3 on dvd, added these to my collection of dvd movie sets. darkman ranks up there with the best, like indiana jones, aliens, star wars, die hard, you get the point. there isn't too many good horror, thriller, sets out there. many thanks to the whole crew, and set for giving us the darkman trilogy. by the way if your wondering how i came across this one on dvd. i purchased it through the internet, it is however region 4, as you know most us dvd players are region 1. if you own a sony playstation 2, you have the best dvd player since it is an all region player. just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want ( 1-9 ).this movie is one of my very favorites. it's hard to explain why. maybe it's the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak, but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. also, some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves. finally, the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings, and the last scene is so bittersweet. all in all, i love this movie; it's perfect for a gooey, sentimental girls' night.there just isn't enough here. there a few funny spots, but not really enough. i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies. i was expecting this to be a hidden gem. it was not. it was a hidden turd.<br /><br />the whole time i was watching it i was thinking, \"geez, i could do better than that and i'm a moron\". don't believe the few good reviews. i was suckered in by them. at no point did i laugh at loud. maybe this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man, it fell flat today. this movie had promise, it just didn't deliver on it. maybe if they rewrote it a few more times. i cant fault the actors. they weren't the best, but they just didn't have much with which to work. this movie failed because of threadbare writing. sorely disappointed.the 100 black and white half-hour episodes of the early situation comedy \"mr. peepers\" were originally broadcast from 1952-55 on nbc. like a lot of baby boomers this and \"ding dong school\" are my earliest memories of television. since both ran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts.<br /><br />\"mr. peepers\" is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value. it represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like \"the honeymooners\" and \"i love lucy\". the genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud abrasive path of those two shows; which is probably why they still seem contemporary. <br /><br />\"mr. peepers\", which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone, may appear slow and dull in comparison. but it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style. once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers. credit should be give to the show's producer, fred coe, a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out (\"philco television playhouse\", \"lights out\", \"playhouse 90\", \"producers showcase\", \"playwrights 56\", \"fireside theatre\", etc.) even on kinescope.<br /><br />\"mr. peepers\" offered a much more gentle style with wally cox (to be the voice of \"underdog\" a few years later) in the title role, robinson peepers, a mild-mannered high school science teacher. his glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer. <br /><br />the series provided cox with an outstanding supporting cast. tony randall played his brash best friend, history teacher harvey weskit. jack warden played frank whip, the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements. <br /><br />there is some love interest competition involving the school's nurse, nancy remington (patricia benoit), with viewers quickly aligning with mr. peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle nancy. their on-screen marriage near the end 1953-54 season captured national attention, an early version of the \"who shot j.r.?\" frenzy.<br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.this is a tepid docu-drama that covers no new ground, reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts. for example, munich is a very flat city. so why is it hilly in the movie? for example, the end of the great war in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice. yet it is announced as a surrender. for example, european news vendors did not (and do not) shout headlines as they hawk their papers. yet this strictly american custom is employed in the film. for example, the nazis did not adopt the german eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as hitler delivers one of his stem winders. indeed, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than hitlerian oratory. the movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the munich hoffbrauhaus. it was not. robert carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject. but his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that. these comments are based on the first episode only. one only can hope the second will be better but don't bet on it.this is a poem on film, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry. it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly. (italy's lake district in the twenties.) it's a love story with a twist. the characters are unique and believable. the settings are deliciously exotic. some of the scenes --- the funeral boat in the fog --- the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor --- are beautiful images. and rather than the mandatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet one. if film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece.<br /><br />deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom, as it primarily takes place on one set. the premise is that an accomplished playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play, to the (loud) protests of his wife. or so you think, for the first half of the movie. past the halfway mark, deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head, then right around, and then in a mad spin, all the time keeping its title appropriate. it's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit. <br /><br />michael caine, as the senior playwright, plays himself in this movie - a slightly loony and very dramatic brit. no surprises here - he does his usual good work. he gets the best line of deathtrap, which he executes perfectly: \"what is your definition of success, being gang-banged in a state penitentiary?\" <br /><br />christopher reeve, on the other hand, juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. he also gets to show off his very toned body, which he must've retained coming off the superman movies. <br /><br />caine and reeve have collaborated in another movie that's one of my favorite comedies - noises off. it similarly revolves around a play as well, although this time caine is the director and reeve is an actor. they are joined by comic veterans carol burnett, john ritter, marilu henner (taxi) and mark linn-baker (perfect strangers). together, they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play. on the surface, the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch. wish this underrated movie was available on dvd.i agree that capital city should be on dvd. i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with rolf saxon as hudson talbot. it was nice to see americans who work abroad in london in the financial industry for a change. i loved rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. i can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. i liked william armstrong as hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. when they aired this show in the new york city area, it was always late at night or at off times. the show is less than an hour long. i felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. i didn't care for sylvia but missed the actress, julia phillips-lane in the previous season. i felt this show took chances and often it worked. it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london. the american characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterparts. i also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british. i liked watching julia ormond in an early role. i felt this show should have lasted longer. i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america.to quote the film, \"it's better not to know. better still to forget. best of all to be abandoned.\" oh, the irony.<br /><br />a ghost story with all the technical refinements of a hollywood horror film, but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film, and you feel like you're being preached to from the start.<br /><br />it's as if the writers' cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop tv and a jerry springer show. fitting, maybe, for a film like the hitcher, not a russia-set horror film. the result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly, not scary or meaningful.you remember the spice girls movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), well their manager simon fuller (also this band's manager) makes the same error putting s club (another of my favourite bands) in their own film. s club: tina barrett, jon lee, bradley mcintosh, jo o'meara, hannah spearritt and rachel stevens (what happened to the seventh member, paul cattermole?) basically ask their boss for a break, they go on, and while there they see themselves on tv! three of them swap, and vice versa, half discover they are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half just get themselves in trouble. also starring gareth gates as a clone of himself. this film may have more of a plot than spice girls' film did, but besides the songs \"bring it all back\", \"don't stop movin'\" and \"never had a dream come true\" this is no goo reason to see this film. not too long after the band split for good. adequate!recap: full moon. a creature, a huge werewolf, is on the hunt. not for flesh, not for blood (not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though), but for a mate. he is on the hunt for a girl. not any girl though. the girl. the girl that is pure (and also a werewolf, although she doesn't know it yet). three, well check that, two cops (after the first scene) and an old bag lady is all that can stop it, or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf. this particular powerful werewolf, darkwolf, is closing in on the girl. if he gets her, mankind is doomed. now the cops has to find the girl, convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf nonetheless, that wants to rape her, and perhaps kill her, but that she is a werewolf herself. and then they got to stop him...<br /><br />comments: this is one for the boys, the teenage boys. a lot of scenes with semi-nude girls more or less important for the plot. mostly less. well i guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is (expectedly) thin. and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking. one usually turns to two main themes. nudity. check. and then special effects. hmm... well there are some things that you might call effects. they're not very special though. in fact, to be blunt, they are very bad. the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds. they couldn't afford clothes for some of the girls ;), and the effects are cheap. some of the transformations between werewolf and human form, obviously done by computer, are really bad. you might overlook such things. but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too, and you never get to see any killings. just some mutilated corpses afterwards. and there is surprisingly little blood about, in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood.<br /><br />i'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. most of the times they do well, but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters (or actors) just looses it. a few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above. like the poor effects, or the poor budget(?). that could explain why there is precious little shooting, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight (and not moving). but hey, when you're in real danger, there nothing that will save your life like a good one-liner...<br /><br />unfortunately that can't explain moments when the cop, steve, the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem, the werewolf that is, runs away, when the only things he can be sure of, is that the werewolf is coming for the girl, who is just beside him now, and that he cannot let it have her. but sure, it let the makers stretch the ending a little more...<br /><br />but i wouldn't mind seeing none of the lead actors/actresses get another try in another movie.<br /><br />well. to give a small conclusion: not a movie that i recommend.<br /><br />3/10alice(claire danes) and darlene(kate beckinsale) have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to thailand. due to a incident, they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him hong kong for the weekend. but at the airport, alice and darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine and they are sent to prison. now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship. this was a pretty good movie, i've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained. claire danes did a great job as usual, she is a great actress. i would give brokedown palace 8/10amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70's, and this, from leading horror scribe robert bloch, is one of their best efforts. there are four stories, all worthwhile, but two -- \"sweets for the sweet\" and \"method for murder\" -- distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear.<br /><br />in \"sweets\", christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter (chloe franks) becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods. franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in \"the innocents\". this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage, occurring off-screen, is a moment of purest horror.<br /><br />\"method of murder\" is about a horror novelist (denholm elliott) who is menaced by one of his own creations, the creepy dominic. this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror. dominic may or may not be real, so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting.<br /><br />the original poster art, featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushing's severed head, was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear.the movie has a great written genre story. it features all of the usual columbo ingredients; the way lt. columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect, the way the mystery unravels for him, columbo's dog, the cat and mouse play, which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor, mostly involving the columbo character. it's all written despite the fact that it doesn't even have a truly original concept. columbo hunting down a detective/murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a columbo movie.<br /><br />it's also an extremely well directed movie from james frawley, who after this directed 5 more columbo movies, in the '70's and '80's. he provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequences.<br /><br />it's one of the slower moving columbo movies, despite not having a too long running time. this style and approach doesn't always work out well for a columbo movie but in this movie it does, which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the movie.<br /><br />most columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of film-making, as the movie its murderer. this movie stars the rather unknown 81 year old ruth gordon. she didn't starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some, mostly for her role in \"rosemary's baby\", which also won her an oscar. she had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting, which some people might not like though. it earned her 4 more oscar nominations throughout her career, prior to her win for \"rosemary's baby\", in 1969. she has some great interaction as well with peter falk in their sequences together.<br /><br />the movie also stars a still young g.d. spradlin. i say young because i only know him from his latest productions out of his career, despite the fact that he already was 57 at the time of this columbo production. he is still alive but retired from acting, ever since 1999.<br /><br />an even better than usual columbo movie entry.<br /><br />8/10this seems like two films: one a dreary, pretentious lengthy saga about an ac-tor who is taken over by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress. shelley winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side. she drops heavy hints about the need for connections, her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modelling game. i love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain, and her terrible seducing outfit of navel-revealing, puff-sleeved crochet top.<br /><br />do actors get oscars for shakespeare? we know they oscars for impersonating disabled people, wearing a lot of prosthetics, or pretending to be mad. the shakespearean scenes (which go on and on) are embarrassing and dated. and so are the 'going mad' scenes where tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice-over.<br /><br />by the way, anthony john is not aristocratic. he makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy. when he quotes his father's advice, he slips into a cockney accent.some illegal so-called asylum seeker comes to stuttgart and finds that germans are \"racist.\" <br /><br />this is just another already-forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post-wwii anti-german propaganda films, aimed to make germans feel \"bad\" for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase german blonds and sell drugs to german teenagers.<br /><br />if you're looking for good german films in general, see \"der tunnel,\" \"der untergang,\" \"europa europa,\" and \"lola rennt.\"<br /><br />but not this.<br /><br />also, \"das experiment,\" with the same male actor from \"lola rennt.\"jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis.<br /><br />i didn't find this particular episode that funny: the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame (jerry is essentially the 'bad guy' in this one, tormenting poor tom for no particular reason).<br /><br />there is the occasional flash of inspiration (such as tom's literal 'heart in mouth' experience, and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body), but, on the whole, this effort lacks the frenetic pacing, excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t&j's other cartoons.an annoying experience. improvised dialogue, handheld cameras for no effect, directionless plot, contrived romance, ick! to the whole mess. ron silver was the only real actor. gretta sacchi was terrible! henry jaglom did better with eating which suited his style much more.somebody needs to send this uli lommel guy back to movie school. who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? can just anybody make movies these days? in the past, it always required talent before someone could make a movie. after watching this lame btk movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as i do. actually i think even i could make better movies than uli lame-all. this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the btk killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. that's it. where did this guy get the big idea that btk killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie? this is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term \"btk\" because of the fame it has achieved. absolutely pitiful. the only serial killer movie i would consider worse is that lame \"dahmer\" movie. that kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous. whoever made that one needs to be shot.this is by far the worst movie i have ever watched. i've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake, no, wait, i mean the the whole damn bakery. it is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created. please just do yourself a favor, if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur barney, then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for. in summation, i guess you really can call it a horror movie, but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story.<br /><br />real rating, -10 disgustingthe lead characters in this movie fall into two categories: smart and stupid. simple enough.<br /><br />jiri machacek (standa) plays a hapless, dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit. when he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil, former boss, the situation gets out of control.<br /><br />while standa is genuinely (but endearingly) stupid, his buddy ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. without ondrej, standa might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success. with ondrej, life will never be boring, but it sure won't be without a lot of headaches!<br /><br />ivan trojan plays zdenek, an evil genius type who degenerates into some hitler-esquire delusional tyrant. zdenek and his henchmen try to kill standa to keep zdenek's secrets safe.<br /><br />i am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of czech films. for a relatively small country, the czech republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment. the best czech movies i have seen are: 1) peliky and 2) tmavomodrý svet (dark blue world). if you see these two movies, you have seen the absolute best of czech cinema.i don't know what it is about this movie- director sam mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie. i would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this movie may be the most important of all time. this movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt 'the worst movie ever made'. i've seen bad movies in my lifetime, but this somehow breaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to imagine.<br /><br />everything in this movie is hilarious, but the single funniest thing is that mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie.<br /><br />oh wow...if there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it. so bad it wasn't intended to be that way. but superb anyway... go find it somewhere. whatever you do... do not miss it!!!catscratch is the best thing to come out of nickeloden, including wayne knight. this show doesn't just appeal to maoris and pi's. some people love it, and they're all aussies. at first glimpse i admit it seems a little crude, but it grows enormously on you. also, to correct something that one of the other critics has said in_correct (tv.com) doesn't say \"does that mean you're homo now?\" he says \"does that mean you're homo, owww?\" this is his phrase in the show. mr. blik is, i think,the funniest of all like peww-weww's playhouse<br /><br />firstly, i'll admit that the early episode were a bit good. but after a while the episodes became great! and just when the series had found it's surreal, whacky ...nickelodeon cancels it!<br /><br />i know nick is meant for kids, but every once in a while a brilliant show appears that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults. these shows include mr. bean the animated series, charlie brown, pelswick, rocko's modern life (at times), and invader zim. all of these must have been considered too good, with the exception of catdog, 'cause nick felt the need to cancel them.<br /><br />what i like the famous final episode, where gordon fight a duck.<br /><br />i'd also like to see a dvd, with plenty of audio-commentaries and behind-the-scenes docos, and including the final episode.<br /><br />but of course, what i'd definitely like to see is the show come back on the air. wake up nick!<br /><br />i wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the gag closing-credits. that would be great.i can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the american audience to the dynamo that is jet li. fist of legend would have been a much better choice. anyway, black mask isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. the final fight sequence is well staged by yuen woo ping who went on to coordinate the matrix. but the english release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (i'm begging the hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.)jet li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and francoise yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.<br /><br />black mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. more focus on li's fantastic physical skills were in order. black mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up fist of legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows li's skills.i think i will make a movie next weekend. oh wait, i'm working..oh i'm sure i can fit it in. it looks like whoever made this film fit it in. i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!! it looks like someones home movie and i don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!! total crap!!! who let's this stuff be released?!?!?!this film is horribly acted, written, directed and produced. but it's so campy it's actually semi-watchable. that's semi watchable.<br /><br />the storyline (what little there is) makes virtually no sense whatsoever. the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /><br />many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials.. none of them went on to anything else that i'm aware of. and of course sly stallone's even less talented brother well..... =\\<br /><br />trivia: it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont, ont. (about 20 miles n.east of toronto) i recognized many local landmarks/intersections/buildings. i think the drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished \"oshawa drive-in\" just before it was torn down.the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. it is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. if done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? the ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time. i'm glad i watched this in class, and not on my own time. i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music. those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. i hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.in the immediate aftermath following world war ii, sound minds in hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag-waving that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. \"best years of our lives' and even 'gentleman's agreement' investigated the way americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war, but delmer daves' \"pride of the marines\" beat them to it.<br /><br />the film is about philadelphia smart alec john garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole, with japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies \"mariiines, tonight you die!\", he is blinded by a hand-grenade, and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home.<br /><br />delmer daves is uncompromising in his depiction on these men who are brave, as it were, almost by coincidence. they are there, in the foxhole, and when shot at, they react. so much for heroism, but they get the job done. and then comes the self-pity, the dark, gloomy sense of humor. garfield is in angry denial of his blindness and the film makes no excuses, \"there's no free candy for anyone in this world\", as his buddy tells him. the same guy, a jew, played by dane clark, reminds him, \"in a war somebody gets it, and you're it. everybody's got problems! when i get back, some guys won't hire me, because my name is diamond\".<br /><br />great movies are made with guts like these, and if the first half hour of 'pride of the marines' fails to rise to the occasion completely, from then on it evolves into a true work of art. you weep, and you ponder, you ache and you hope against hope. well, simply: art.<br /><br />you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies, even the really bad ones? why? to see their heroes in action one more time. that's the way i feel about doc savage. i am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. and the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation. then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. there's a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the \"camp\" elements, etc.) but the spirit of doc is there, and that's what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to. so, in my long-winded way, what i'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. and anyone who is a fan of superman, james bond, indiana jones, buckaroo banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.in sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! the director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. to boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. additionally, the film is not really realistic. liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals. i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover's son. by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either ismael or primarily nora. to the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball's chance in hell. the actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater. as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic, tear-jerking barbra streisand film; something like the way we were. i was certainly wrong. the chemistry between the two main characters, esther hoffman and her john howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters. there wasn't anything romantic about it. streisand's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast-forward button. at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. there's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies. parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on, and i kept asking myself when it was going to end.<br /><br />the death of john howard was completely predictable. there was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie, and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever. it wasn't a tragic accident, it was him basically being an idiot. not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beard.<br /><br />the only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs. the ending of the movie when she sings \"with one more look at you/watch closely now\" was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3/10. those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.an actor asks, \"what's my motivation?,\" to understand his or her character. after viewing this this \"docudrama,\" this vague and haphazard farce, a viewer wonders what anyone's motivation was.<br /><br />this inept offspring of daytime t.v. (the oprah show) missed by a mile a great opportunity to explore weighty issues.<br /><br />its characters were all shallow and superficial, its story line far less socially redeeming than a \"simpsons\" episode. it gratuitously portrayed investigating police as unprofessional and incompetent. it failed to offer why the court might treat the main character, a female child molester, so differently than it would have a male perp.<br /><br />why did this unrepentant woman begin \"grooming\" her second grade student, beginning an affair with him when he returned to her sixth grade class? why did the boy's mother testify in her behalf? the simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, plus generational rationalization and greed. the movie gave no hint of that.<br /><br />why wasn't the viewer informed that the victim's mother sold interview rights to print and television tabloids, parading her adolescent son on \"the today show\"? that mary kay's lawyer cashed in, she herself appealing a \"son of sam\" statute so she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder?<br /><br />why wasn't it explained that letourneau's father was a former right wing republican congressman, the 1972 american independent presidential candidate, the john birch society president? in 1983 john schmitz's political career ended when he was found to have had children by his own community college student, exposed only when that mistress sexually mutilated their infant son? yet letourneau's dad had removed his many kids from \"too liberal\" catholic schools, fighting to keep all schoolchildren from receiving any sex education?<br /><br />a month after her conditional release, again pregnant with the now 14-year-old's second daughter, mary kay received 7 1/2 years in prison for numerous probation violations. a prophetic editorial regarding the sad affair then appeared in the seattle times: \"at the end of two wretched hours, letourneau was led off to jail, and this salacious melange of made-for-tv seaminess was over, until casting begins.\"<br /><br />sure enough, 18 months later, filming of this travesty was underway.super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. the imax camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix (if only that would appear on dvd!). i enjoy watching it again and again.<br /><br />the only minus, and why i didn't give it a 10, is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up. the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. you won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges.although it's most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk, there's such a charm to dudley moore's portrayal of lovable lush, arthur bach one can't help but feel for this unique and wonderful character. how can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness. although i'm not really a liza minnelli fan, she was really excellent as linda marolla and i couldn't picture anyone else in that role. sir john gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his oscar. the rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune \"arthur's theme\", wow. truly this was one of the best comedies of the 1980s. great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with \"arthur.\"farewell friend aka adieu l'ami/honour among thieves isn't perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault, one to return stolen bonds, the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend. naturally things aren't quite that simple even after they open the vault, leading to some neat twists and turns. on the debit side, there's a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park, bronson has a very irritating fonzie-like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments, brigitte fossey, sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s (it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind), is something of a liability  her \"i'll cook spaghetti! i'll learn to make love well! i'll read shakespeare!\" speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways  and it's a shame about the horrible last line/shot, but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that's worth checking out if you can find a decent print.<br /><br />cinema club's uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack, but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that's no great problem, especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality.this inferior sequel based by the characters created by david selzer and harvey bernhard(also producer) concern on a matrimony named gene(michael woods) and karen york(faye grant). they adopt a little girl named delia from a convent. gene york about re-elect for congressman and he presides the financing committee. meanwhile, delia seems to be around when inexplicable deaths happen. she creates wreak havoc when goes a metaphysical fair, as stores of numerology, therapy, counselling heal,yoga, tarots, among others are destroyed. karen york hires an eye private(michael lerner) to investigate the weird and bizarre events.<br /><br />this tv sequel displays thrills, chills, creepy events and gory killing. delia such as damien seems to dispatch new eerie murder every few minutes of film, happening horrible killings . the chief excitement lies in watching what new and innocent victim can be made by the middling special effects. furthermore, mediocre protagonists, faye grant and michael woods, however nice cast secondary, such as michael lerner,madison mason, duncan fraser and the recently deceased don s davis, he was an army captain turned into acting. as always , excellent musical score taken from omen i and iii by the great jerry goldsmith. the movie is exclusively for hardcore followers omen saga. the motion picture is badly directed by jorge montesi and dominique othenin girard. previous and much better versions are the following : the immensely superior original 'omen'(gregory peck, lee remick)by richard donner; 'damien'(william holden, lee grant) by don taylor; 'final conflict'(sam neil and tisa harrow) by grahame baker. rating : below average.stupid and just plain weird movie about some kid who becomes traumatized when he finds out santa isn't real (???). he grows up and becomes an adult (brandon maggart) who makes lists of people who are naughty or nice. one christmas he snaps and sets out to kill the naughty people--dressed as santa of course.<br /><br />boring and just plain bad killer santa movie. if you're looking for gore, it's not here. only a few of the murders are shown and they're not that gory with very fake effects. most of the movie just contains brandon maggart talking to himself and slowly going crazy. the script is trite, the acting is terrible and it leads to an ending which had me staring slack-jawed at the tv. seriously, i had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure i wasn't hallucinating! really really poor ending.<br /><br />if you want a scary christmas flick rent \"black christmas\" (the original 70s version---not the terrible remake). avoid this one at all costs.oh yes, sakura killers is a goofy, horrible ninja movie, make no mistake. but it's also an incredibly enjoyable one. this is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one chuck connors, who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes. i suppose he's supposed to be sort of an obi wan kenobi type (\"the tough ninja-buster\", the box copy exclaims) but his 'wisdom' is laughable. \"move without thinking\"??? my friend says this is the sign of mental retardation, not of supreme concentration.<br /><br />but really, his two aides, sonny and dennis, have such horrible dialogue that 'brooklyn', as we call the colonel, tends to shine in comparison. especially watch for dennis' logic regarding the 'genetic splicing' the sakura are involved with. if you know anything about cloning you will die laughing. and yes, this is a major plot point, folks.<br /><br />a terribly fun movie, sakura killers is a hard-to-find gem. i won't spoil the 'trick' ending for you either, except that it's a perfect set up for a sakura killers 2. too bad chuck connors died. :-( because he does have a the smoothest ways of blowing away ninjas.this film is one of those nostalgia things with me and i never really expect anyone else to \"get it\" but am pleased when i recommend it and somebody does enjoy it. my late father hated arthur askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for \"the ghost train\" and \"old ted 'olmes\" transferred to me as a child. years later, i watch it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. i always wonder if it will not be quite the same but i am never disappointed in it. there is much to enjoy. the sequence on the train is truly inspired when askey and murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger. then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up. yes, it is dated and full of wartime britishness in accents and plot (based on the original play by arnold ridley of dad's army fame!) but full of wonderful character performances - including kathleen harrison as a dotty spinster. the atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an arthur askey vehicle could get. this is available cheap as chips in the uk on dvd so treat yourself. it is a perfect saturday/sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment. i thank you....<br /><br />old movies can be good movies!never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films! bob fosse's \"star 80\" about dorothy stratten, of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen. patty hansen is no actress either..i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful \"poodlesque\" hair-do....very disappointing....\"paper moon\" and \"the last picture show\" i could watch again and again. this clunker i could barely sit through once. this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms. stratten's tawdry death; i think the real reason was because it was so bad!cafe lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity. unacquainted with the work of the director, i am well-acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to - ozu yasujiro. while not even approaching ozu in greatness, hou has communicated nothing of ozu's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space. one of the things he misses entirely is ozu's attention to character - we are not even \"introduced\" by hou to his lead character (a perfect blank page). there are no medium or close shots of his people. one of the dvd extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what hou doesn't - a good look at their faces.<br /><br />there was a great spanish film by bardem called nunca pasa nada, which translates to something like \"nothing ever happens\". that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise. all through the film we are given clues about an obscure taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack. but the clues, like everything else, add up to nothing. unless you're a trainspotter, this film has nothing to recommend it.any movie with \"national lampoon\" in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london,england,paris,france,rome,italy,and anywhere in germany.it may be an institution in the u.s. but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience.\"national lampoon's european vacation\" is unlikely to rectify that situation. the appalling griswalds are just that - appalling.they are not funny. clearly mr chevy chase thinks he's funny, after all miss b.di angelo laughs a lot at his jokes,but she's getting paid for it and didn't have to fork out £2.50 for the privilege. the section set in england is typical.the same old same old tv performers, messrs idle,smith,coltrane,miss m.lippman trot out the same old same old tired clichés,mr chase gets lost in the hotel corridor....yawn,yawn,yawn.. bucking - ham palace,big ben......i feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two-by-two.........rosie red cheeks on the little chil - dren,need i go on? the english are buffoons,the french vicious - tongued yank-haters.the germans pompous and puffed up,(don't mention the war,clark),and the italians lecherous bottom-pinchers.have i forgotten anything? every possible \"comic\" situation is worked to death,mr chase gurns desperately,miss di angelo dimples sweetly,the children are embarrassingly bad. the fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste.i watched this flick yesterday and i have to say it's the finest horror film made for $36,000 i've ever seen (sorry steckler) the film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan. this movie reeks of soul and atmosphere. some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film. very creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims. brrrrrrr.<br /><br />hot saggy canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the horror rears its undead corpse eating head. this film entertained from start to finish. i couldn't ask for more than that. my only complaint is that is was too short.i still don't know why i forced myself to sit through the whole thing. this \"film\" wasn't worth the memorex dvd-r it was burned on; i thought i was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' camcorder. this is by far the worst movie ever made. i truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue aaron yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life.<br /><br />so apparently, it's supposed to be bad on purpose; however, if you should end up in hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo, you'll see that yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick. the actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to crimson tide but come closer to the marine.<br /><br />the crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. the camera angles are awful. the story is c-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered b-movie caliber. the dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty, but is crap like everything else. rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies. plus, the techno score is annoying... not because it's techno, but because it's non-stop. that's right, the music plays in the background the whole time, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. i don't care what the disclaimer claims, i don't buy it. bots was not made this bad on purpose, because it takes itself way too serious for what it was: a joke.<br /><br />this \"film\" was very low-budget. but that is no excuse for its record-setting suck factor. great films are born of substance, not budget. bots had neither.<br /><br />allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if i were having a three-way with jessica alba and jessica biel in front of a tv and blood of the samurai came on, i'd be out of there quicker than steven seagal in executive decision.<br /><br />undoubtedly, some people will try to defend the movie. two, maybe three. they'll say, \"it's grindhouse chop-socky!\" or \"cheesy in a good way!\" or \"it's so bad, it's good!\" those people are idiots. a movie is either good, or it's bad. there's no such thing as a good bad movie. but there are such things as idiots that like crappy movies. don't get me wrong; there are lots of cornball not-to-be-taken-seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining. slither is one. bots is not.<br /><br />this suckfest runs about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, it's 90 minutes too long. the best thing about this \"film\" is the dvd cover, so next time you're near the wal-mart dvd bargain bin, take a look at it-- don't touch it, just look-- and quietly walk away.obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production. but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot. i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other (great) chinese films. i first saw this when i was 14 years old, i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything...yeah, it is. in fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies. number 15, i think. anyways, i'm usually not one for plots, but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games, (final fantasy 7, for example) and not movies. but this one has it all. vivid drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well written screenplay. while this is not really for children, they can still watch it, it contains no graphic blood, guts and silicone. but i don't think they're going to understand it.i saw this movie when it first came out. it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival and i voted for it for best picture.<br /><br />justine priestley is hot as the psychotic, but complex amanda. this is not your ordinary psycho movie. lots of interesting and original slants on the genre. sort of a \"fatal attraction\" for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of amanda's affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off.<br /><br />darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie (samaire armstrong) who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary (tippi hedren) is killed by a werewolf, you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley (ryan olosio) who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself & that a so-called 'dark prince' werewolf (kane hodder) wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world, or something like that. understandably josie has a hard time believing it, that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes. it's up to werewolf cop steve to save josie, the day & the world...<br /><br />co-executive produced & directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn't really do anything for me. the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show & then there's a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it's pretty much down hill all the way i'm afraid. for a start it's slow going, it's dull, it's predictable & it's populated with highly annoying character's who come out with lots of bad dialogue & do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don't, i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead. the script is dumb & doesn't explain itself, why has josie never turned into a werewolf before? is she really the only one? why can't this 'dark prince' find another female werewolf? there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half-way through but you get the idea anyway, as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least.<br /><br />director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original & doesn't really improve the film as a spectacle. now let's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special, the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi & it's among the worst looking cgi i've ever seen, seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics. it's easily the worst werewolf transformation i've ever seen, an american werewolf in london (1981) was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light-years ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf, who says special effects have improved over the years? the animatronic puppet effects aren't much better either although at least there's something psychical on screen. the gore isn't up to much after a gory opening kill there's some blood splatter & plenty of dead bodies but not much else. thre's a fair amount of female nudity if that's your thing but don't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it, is it really worth it?<br /><br />technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever, it's reasonably well made & it at least seems to have production values. the acting is what you'd expect really.<br /><br />darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves & clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations, i didn't think it was as bad as some but it's like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said & done they're both horrible still...by the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet. the movie never, and i do mean never, lets up in action. it may be mild action but it's action. once again every member of the cast fits perfectly. the explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were feasible, and the fighting was incredible. matt damon will forever be jason bourne.<br /><br />all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception. the action, the stakes, the plot. how they do it i will never know. i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies. because if he hadn't done such a great job with the first movie, we wouldn't have this one to talk about.<br /><br />so don't go see it in theaters, go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if not december 11th bourne comes home to you!after viewing \"whipped\" at a distributor's screening at the afm the other night, i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed. the audience was laughing all the way through. unfortunately, every territory was already sold, so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film, but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas. i agree with the comment that \"whipped\" should not be pitched as a male \"sex and the city,\" mainly because unlike \"sex and the city,\" \"whipped\" is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously. \"whipped\" pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldn't dare. also, the film that i screened at the afm had more of a plot and story than \"swingers,\" \"clerks,\" and \"sex and the city\" combined. \"whipped\" never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non-stop comedy. the performances of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid, which only made the film more impressive considering the budget.it really is that bad of a movie. my buddy rented it because he, well, is an idiot. but then again, i must be an idiot too because i watched the whole damn thing! the actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think that are going places. the only place they will be going is back to waiting tables at luby's. all i could think of while i was watching this \"gem\" was how it actually got made. i mean, some \"screenwriter\" actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return on it. actors were cast, locations were scouted, make-up artists were hired, computer animators fresh out of al collins graphic design school were brought in and this turd started to take form.<br /><br />there obviously were a ton of things that i hated about this move but the one thing the drove me the craziest was the overuse of music. every single minute of this flick was scored. there was not a single break in music. and at times it was mixed higher than the dialogue, not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything.<br /><br />after it was over, we decided to watch mystic river. it was like driving a 1980 vw diesel rabbit then switching to a bmw 740il. you couldn't get two more opposite movies in terms of quality.i mean really, how could charles band the head of full moon let a total stink-ball like demonicus out. i mean it should never got the green light to begin with. the story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story on tyranus other then he's a bad dude. then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending. that's right a bad ending, demonicus rises. the last survivor escapes a deadly cave in, then a picture of chimera comes to life, cheaply i might add and chases her out. then as she is walking home ala funhouse. a statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her. i mean, that makes no sense. what the hell was charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made, with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies. they could have asked me, i had better ideas then demonicus. thanksgiving turkey.this movie is good for what it is, and unpretentious; i wouldn't watch it twice, however: i am a peter cushing completist and that's why i watched it. the best asset of this movie is: brevity and effectiveness. compared to other similar movies, it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four (plus one) segments lasts under 30 minutes, with the last under 10. good uncanny vibes. in the first segment, horror writer suffering from 'writer's block' relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration. he finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen. plot contrivance similar to premature burial. good use of the point-of-view twist: is the writer getting mentally ill...or (as the ending shows) his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband's phobias to drive him mad & secure his estates...yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan?<br /><br />in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth, which had once separated them. from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer...or was she?<br /><br />the third segment was the less interesting to me.<br /><br />the fourth shows a horror movies actor -who thinks he's the best of all- sunken to the depths of low budget c movies. seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire, he gets the real deal. this segment also lacks the solidity of the first two.<br /><br />acting is fair, with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it. good movie, taken with a grain of salt. not the best cushing, nor lee...but worth watching.this movie was bad to say the least!!! the plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this lame movie. it starts off with a race from l.a. to las vegas to be completed in 1hr 45min...in a ferrari f430. i did that in 1hr 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140hp 1993 honda accord. seriously...this movie does not do justice to these cars. obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 o'clock. i remember seeing on the news how eddie griffin crashed a 1.5 million dollar ferrari enzo going 30-40mph>>> youtube.com/watch?v=cnvrmzx2kms <br /><br />and...the director andy cheng is the biggest sellout!!! he brings shame to his own race. i wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into hollywood. he partook in a movie that portrays asian americans in such a negative and false way. asian women>>cheap money grubbing whores. asian men>>losing compulsive gamblers & thugs that get beat all the time . what the heck is all the fear about asians?? why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation?? i am so sick of the way hollywood always portrays asians in such a negative and false pretext.i don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said. honestly i have only myself to be angry with. i should have know better when i saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but i loved war games so i indulged my whim. i will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. from the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game i knew i was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. the list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long i would crash imdb if i tried to post it. to those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me. i am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.here in brazil is very rare to see a good brazilian film, and brant´s new film is exactly one of these jewel. there are some flaws in the film, of course, but they are very minimal. the directing and acting in this film are very good!<br /><br />can´t wait to see another brant´s new film!i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original -- have not seen, and doubt i will. it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (jimmy fallon).<br /><br />fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. he's supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot. not fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she's moving on. and rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for fallon, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago. but of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.this is one of the very worst films clark gable made. only parnell was obviously worse. it is just so painfully clichéd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of making.<br /><br />gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going' to the slammer (like the gangster talk?). she holds out hope that he'll do the right thing but he just leaves her there--unknown to either of them, gosh, that she's \"in the family way\". eventually, the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending! they seemed to have forgotten about gable's needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow. leonard maltin says \"the stars are at their best here\". by what standard? best at producing unintended chuckles? gimme a break!<br /><br />ps--after saying this, my wife thinks leonard maltin is going to find me and kick my butt. hmmm. however, despite my comment, i think mr. maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet (i hope that appeased him).<br /><br />update--2/2/08. because i disliked this film so much the first time (especially the ridiculous ending), i decided to watch it once again. after all, sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more and realize that i was a bit too harsh. while that has been the case with several films in recent months, i still disliked this film--even the second time. most of it was not because of the first half of the film. in the first half, harlow's character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable. but when she was sent to prison, it was all clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred. the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb--it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons. i stand by my original review (despite all the \"not helpfuls\") and think that aside from parnell and possibly polly at the circus, it might just be the worst gable film.this is available on a \"drive in double feature\" from dark sky films, and since i just had finished up \"barracuda\", i watched this too. this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time.<br /><br />we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town, but where exactly are they? they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor, and try on chinese-style clothes at a shop, but then we see some aztec dancers? and all the while, these girls are being followed by two guys, who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town, and they finally catch them.<br /><br />it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it? so, in flashback, we go back to find out. and how did they know she had this coin? hard to say, really.<br /><br />now, back in the day, when these two women were 10 years old, they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat, and after stopped to get air in their tanks, they tow this young boy back to his home dock, only to have his grandpa come out & invite the \"young 'uns\" up for herbal tea with granny. but not everyone has the tea, todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls, and then when they're away from it, the boat blows up, and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared. well, it seems as though these \"kindly folk\" raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell, and serve it herbal tea.<br /><br />but the girls and todd did leave the island, but now, they're returning, escorted by their captors, and they're there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before. there also seems to be someone else on the island, and the thugs mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and since there's only three, it doesn't take long. and there's even a sort of happy ending, which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br />the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues, and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious. the hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability, despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden, who appeared in many films and tv shows. the action is confusing, the locales are even more confusing, and the island looks like southern california.<br /><br />so what the hell is this? i'm not sure, but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.a terrible amateur movie director (no, not todd sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. the friend and sister fall in and get rescued. meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf'. whatever the heck that means. this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that it's.. well bad. the humor is painfully unfunny, the \"action\" merely sad. now i've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films, yet i still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this. only for the most hardened maschocists amongst you. but the rest run away fast!!<br /><br />my grade: fso what's the big fuss out of making an indiana jones wannabe when you have an actor who's cast as a fictional dude from adventure storybooks who doesn't want to go out on an adventure??? whoever wrote the script for jake speed was probably fired, but for whatever reasons possible, this movie greatly lacks in excitement! that doesn't mean it has no action, but look on the dark side of the picture. this has got to bare no resemblance to indiana jones or other action-adventure thrills containing cliffhangers and narrow escapes, and jake speed was promoted that way using clever propaganda to make me and several others interested in it! besides, i've never heard of the guy, so who needs his attention?i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in nürnberg, and it was superb. i do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion/xylophone player influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic nibelungen saga.<br /><br />if you are interested in silent films or in the nibelungenlied, i highly recommend this film. the costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of silent film \"tragedies\") unfortunately, i have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns siegfried. the story of this second film begins after siegfried's death, when kremhild (gudrun in the norse versions of the story) begins to plan her revenge against her brothers.<br /><br />also, i watched this film in german; i am a native english speaker and have a basic german knowledge. it was difficult to read the ?subtitles (what do you call that in silent films?) at first because of the old style german script, so i advise that if you watch it in german that you make sure you can differentiate your \"k's\", \"f's\", and \"s's\" in the old script. :)okay, i absolutely love ben stiller, although i am lukewarm about jennifer aniston. i do not think this girl can act in the least. every movie or sitcom i've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting. it sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script. this movie only had one good thing about it, and that's that ben stiller was in it. this plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous. how many movies have this same type of plot?? can we say \"forces of nature??\" not only is the plot so old, but the outcome is so predictable, it's boring. i knew everything that was going to happen before it did. it was a bore, but watching stiller is always a delight!!!brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests, but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all. the re-animator sequels aren't as great as the original, but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned. return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series; and society isn't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece. this thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece; but it shows yuzna's eye for horror excellently, and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging. i'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn't turn up until 1996, as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it's running away from a tiger for the modern world. dentistry doesn't frighten me, but surprisingly; i would appear to be in the minority. the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone. he has a nice house, a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want. however, his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner. and his life isn't the only one; as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger...<br /><br />when it comes to scaring the audience, this movie really makes itself. however, credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline, only with the dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing. it isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this won't be winning any awards, the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot. the acting, while b-class, is actually quite impressive; with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge. i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie. the dawn of the dead star doesn't get enough work, and i really love seeing him in films. the rest of the cast doesn't massively impress, but all do their jobs well enough. overall, the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies. the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans, and i don't hesitate to recommend this film.this movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes, dreams, love and friendship, and incorporates humour beautifully. along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming, the sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art. all actors and actresses give an extremely good performance, surpassing expectation in every way. parminder nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film, and she is exceptional, capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about. keira knightly also works well with her co-stars, and this is her best work so far.<br /><br />all in all, this is brilliant film, and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once.first let me say that i am not a dukes fan, but after this movie the series looked like law and order. the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg. burt reynolds is not boss hogg, and even worse was m.c. gainey as roscoe, if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop. he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this movie.<br /><br />the movie is loaded with the usual errors, cars getting torn up, and continues like nothing happened. the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett, and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop, but goes on to win the race.my friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home the convent, a horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it. given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious, i can say that in some weird way, i like this movie. <br /><br />yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie i've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! \"what, are you smoking ca-rack?!\" i didn't know this movie even was ever released... i figured it was too bad... <br /><br />yeah, so... overall the movie is pretty bad (you gotta admit that much at least) but i promise you, you will get a good laugh out of it.<br /><br />*this movie kinda sucks but it's good for a laugh... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. the dagger of despaaaaaair!i saw the original \"chorus line\" on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater. michael bennett knew he would have to re-imagine \"chorus\" for the screen but could never figure out how to do it. if the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. however, richard attenborough fresh of the musical work of \"ghandi\" and dancing with animals in \"doctor doolittle\" ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show. horrible songs were added (surprise! surprise!), great songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). michael douglas was mis-cast. people that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy \"landers\" woman who couldn't sing, act, or dance - i guess she had just finished being ghandi's wife. the dances by jeffrey hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from \"flashdance\" rejects and nothing works. i sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing. if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 - see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was \"a chorus line\" has any thing at all to do with this film.rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution. what's more attractive about \"la anglaise...\" (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics that rohmer has achieved. the images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures. in some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in louvre musseum. every shot is like a piece of art.<br /><br />*my rate: 7.5/10<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />-------------- -<br /><br />------------<br /><br />-------------------i have watched this movie well over 100-200 times, and i love it each and every time i watched it. yes, it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable. the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as camp really is, a great place to spend the summer. everyone who has ever gone to camp, wanted to go to camp, or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids.the events of the 11th of september 2001 cast its shadow on this oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the all singing all dancing comedy extravaganza that we`d come to expect of this award show but this was by no means a bad thing . entertainment was more or less curtailed to a lotr send up with ben stiller and owen wilson and that was it . the rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations and i have to admit this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance numbers we`ve seen over the years and whoopi goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric david letterman from a few years ago and the one minute silence for the victims of 9/11 was haunting and dignified <br /><br />as for the awards new zealand was absolutely robbed . fellowship of the ring went home with four minor awards while a beautiful mind undeservingly picked up most of the major prizes except for best actor which should have gone to a tough guy new zealander but went to an an all american nice guy instead . the only oscar awards i agreed with apart from the ones presented to fellowship were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor , both correct calls .this review is for the extended cut of this movie.<br /><br />i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago. i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea.<br /><br />that being said. i've always found the storyline a bit confusing. the movie is, after all, a love story. and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene.<br /><br />well, in the extended version this is no longer so. the old \"original\" version begins off with a huge barrel-climb/rugby-like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version. the opening sequence is dragon(jackie chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around.<br /><br />other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it. the pacing is also better and overall it just works better. it feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does.<br /><br />i suggest everyone who is a hong-kong cinema, or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.(or at least that's how i think it was intended. why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes) when i was done watching it, i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same.this movie is awesome. i watched it the other day with my cousin jay-jay. he said it was alright, but i think it rulezzz! i mean, it's so cool. ted v. mikels is so brave and smart. he made a movie totally unlike those terrible hollywood films, like the matrix and stop or my mom will shoot. it could have been better, though. i like ninjas and pirates. i also like that big talon that the funny man wears. i think he's the coolest guy since that domino pizza claymation guy. not only does this movie look really cool, like those out-of-focus movies my dad made of my birthday when i turned 6. but it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated, but they all meet up in the end. it's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up. i wish ted v. mikels would make a sequel. but it needs more aliens. and a pirate.my name is john mourby and this is my story about paperhouse: in may 2003 i saw alfred hitchcock's psycho, i was very scared and deeply disturbed. i began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way. but none where satisfactory. amongst those tried and failed were the birds, night of the living dead, the silence of the lambs, the blair witch project, ring, the evil dead, the sixth sense, 28 days later, the texas chainsaw massacre, halloween, near dark, alien, peeping tom, the cell, rosemary's baby, don't look now, witchfinder general, friday the 13th and the omen. that should confirm i was desperate! long after i had stopped searching i found out about paperhouse .<br /><br />paperhouse is based on a favourite book that i own, called marianne dreams. paperhouse had also come up in some of the books i had found on horror films, but they didn't tell me about the link between book and film. i discovered the truth while on the internet, i bought the film later that day.<br /><br />i thought paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull. unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not. it was the answer to my prayers marianne is renamed anna in the film but most of the original story is the same. one day in school anna draws a house in her scrap book (nothing remarkable about that) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house (and i mean genuinely unnerving). more she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld, eg an apple tree. anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world. mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house, obligingly anna draws in a lighthouse (a place to go to) but still the problem remains mark can't walk. so anna decides to draw her father in. she gets her pencil out and gets too work, but the outcome is deformed and unsettling anna particularly dislikes his eyes. quote \"he looks like madman\". so anna tries to rub him out and start again, but the pencil proves indelible (that means nothing can be rubbed out). then anna loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes! i leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action.<br /><br />paperhouse truly is the british answer to a nightmare on elm street! the viewing of this film left me shocked and upset. but i have found what i was looking for after 2 years. the question is how dose the compare with psycho? answer, 1 the old dark house, 2 psychological parental fears, 3 a genuine shock, 4 and very scary music.the king maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the portuguese occupation in indochina.<br /><br />although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer. the acting, in particular, was extremely poor. some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. the storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. the movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an asian version of elizabeth.<br /><br />final say? costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion. in short, the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script.this movie is horrible. the acting is a waste basket. no crying, no action, hopeless songs. though the scenery is great. i have always wanted to go to greece.<br /><br />anyway, as for saif, you'd expect a great performance, but even he let down the people.<br /><br />akshay kumar, recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs. he was sensational in this movie. for only this performance, filmfare should introduce another award. the toiletries award for the worst performance. by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat.<br /><br />kareena kapoor. she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma. in acting, in looks, or in body. she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her. she comes into this movie wearing bikini's and tank tops and short shorts. i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife-to-be dress like that. but, she must've impressed some people dressing like that. and if you ask how, then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie. they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom. including me. personally i think that she dressed like a whore, but i really liked it.<br /><br />i am forced to give it a 1/10, but i'd really give this movie a 0/10. an unachieved film.this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen. usually, the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them. not ice age. i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel.<br /><br />ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch. the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby, set 20,000 years in the past. the visuals were great. simply beautiful. it's one thing to create convincing aninmation, it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals. blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future.lorne michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies.<br /><br />you'd think that after such dismal flicks \"superstar\", \"night at the roxbury\", and \"coneheads\", he'd start to get the notion that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many would argue that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television, as well). trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on snl makes no sense.<br /><br />i personally like tim meadows, and think that he would be great in the right movie. it's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation, and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene. any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny.<br /><br />oh well, at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired snl characters who will never have films done about them. it's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen.gayniggers from outer space is a short foreign film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon earth. being gay, their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay. hence, when they discover women or \"female creatures\" live on earth, they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population.<br /><br />an offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist storyline, albeit probably intended as a satire, give this film some shock value. however, there's little substance underneath. as another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes besides the characters' names (eg. arminass); i think i laughed once at one small gay joke. i think i got the point of the film quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that i had had enough; i kept wanting the film to end already (and it is a short film!). not brilliant or particularly well-written.i have not seen this movie, but i must. having read all three of thor heyerdahl's books (kon tiki, ra and aku aku) i am actively looking for a copy of this movie.<br /><br />the thesis that peruvians migrated to polynesia is alive and well. considering that this crew had no gps, and only an old fashioned valve (tube) radio with a 6-watt output, their voyage was heroic to say the least.<br /><br />please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video.<br /><br />i would be interested in buying it.another fun, witty, frothy rko musical with astaire and rogers, follow the fleet is a charming film. while it lacks the stand-out great tunes of swng time (although the final number \"face the music and dance\" is one of the team's best and rightfully so), it is hugely enjoyable, as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930's. once again, the plot is lightweight and forgettable, but watching fred and ginger dance together is sheer heaven. these two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene. while there are better fred and ginger musicals, this is certainly a must-see.if asked how i would define the word \" shallow \" i would reply \" watch a jerry bruckheimer production \" . if asked how i would define the phrase \" wasted potential \" i would reply \" watch a jerry bruckheimer production \" . bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics . off the top of my head i can only think of an officer and a gentleman and black hawk down getting a lot of critical acclaim . <br /><br />crimson tide too received some begrudging acclaim from critics , it`s certainly one of bruckheimer`s better films which alas isn`t saying much . the problem i had is the scenario that sets up the story : the russians are fighting the chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of russia leading to an ultra nationalist russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the west if they interfere . maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but i found this set up very unconvincing . it`s not helped by some errors in geography like the french carrier foch being in the med ( wouldn`t the foch be better positioned in the black sea ? ) or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the balkans , the first gulf war and even vietnam . once again the adjective \" very unconvincing \" crept into my mind . the story does improve somewhat when the story proper - a battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway . director tony scott does his best as do the cast , but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . the worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when ww3 was a real possibility - nay probability - this film would have terrified me , but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means crimson tide has little impact .it's hard to criticize this movie, because i dislike the story itself, and no amount of good acting would have saved it. think \"raising arizona\" with a mean streak. the acting is passable, but jennifer tilly is way over the top (yet not enough to make this a nice camp film) as usual, coming in somewhere between \"misery\" and a sarcastic dmv employee. the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation, either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise. a real degrading few hours of film. darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood. i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out, sorry.tara reid as an intellectual, christian slater(usually great) as a dollar store constantine and stephen dorff as...well it's stephen dorff for christ sake!!!! i personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. you guys are on. heres an idea, just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices,a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this, heres the clincher they have to be played by jessica simpson and paris hilton. i knew you guys would love that. seriously though you owe me $7.50.some have compared this film to deliverance. i believe of mice and men is more appropriate. our leading man, heaton, definitely loves spike. it is irrelevant and immaterial whether that is a sexual love. it is the reason heaton does not leave spike. he needs him. they need each other. as brothers, as family, as their only connection to humanity. the setting, scenario, minimal cast all add up to a fine film. frankly, i did not care what happened to the characters. but, i did care about what the film maker did with them. he did well with them. i spent some time wondering how the ending would resemble of mice and men. the soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing.how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me. overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie. terrible script, with forced character quirks (the brown sauce). romanticising all that is bad about dublin. the attitude of 'ah, it's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same'. plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences (the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase). and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney's character. a great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old. cringeworthy stuff. the best thing about this movie is farrell, and it's a bad when you have to say that. well, at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent. international audiences be warned: stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock. you'll have a better time. intermission is a walk-outeri liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell (played by p.j. soles) is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song \"i want you around\" ...very very cool stuff.<br /><br />it was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. yes i'll admit that the ending is way-way over the top and far fetched ...but it doesn't matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie. it's sex, pot and rock n rocll forever<br /><br />i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this ..but i do not know if this is true or notthis was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors. these were called \"instructional\" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny-looking main character called \"pvt. snafu.\"<br /><br />all of us have imaginations, along with fears and what-have-you, and that's what happens here as pvt. snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with \"five.\" you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause, as pointed out here in this cartoon. a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy. that's still being done today. <br /><br />\"we lost the war,\" declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon. amazing how some americans still haven't learned. this cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today. as i write this, there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the \"war on terror\" is just a bumper sticker slogan. amazing.<br /><br />the writer, the famous \"dr. suess,\" uses analogies of \"hot air balloon juice\" here to present the above message. with theodore geisel (his real name) you know the rhymes will be clever.<br /><br />nothing hilarious here, but it wasn't meant to be. you have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii. people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning. it was a tense timeko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all times. believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it. but truth is that the humour in this comedy is special.it is caratherisic for serbia. and all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well!!! so i think the rest of audience (for example: in europe)can't enjoy it so much. because the subtitles ruin the hole thing. but they should at least try!!!! yes it is ironic! this is the best flick in serbian history and the world doesn't understand it! :-) if you have got a chance to see this one, don't blew up ok!i found about the movie \"holes\" by hearing from people that it wasn't typical disney, that both kids and adults both got into the story. folks, let me tell you i wasn't disappointed. \"holes\" is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats, a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert. he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives. it was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. i didn't know quite what to expect when i watched it. it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle. the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr. sir. now that i've seen the movie, i have to read the book. most recommended!contains spoilers. <br /><br />the british director j. lee thompson made some excellent films, notably 'ice cold in alex' and 'cape fear', but 'country dance' is one of his more curious offerings. the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland, and details the strange triangular relationship between sir charles ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister hilary, and hilary's estranged husband douglas, who is hoping for a reconciliation with her. we learn that during his career as an army officer, charles was regarded as having 'low moral fibre'. this appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world, and his main sources of emotional support seem to be hilary and his whisky bottle. the film ends with his committal to an upper-class lunatic asylum. <br /><br />peter o'toole was, when he was at his best as in 'lawrence of arabia', one of britain's leading actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven, and 'country dance' is not one of his better films. he overacts frantically, making charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat, as though he were auditioning for a part in the monty python 'upper-class twit of the year' sketch. susannah york as hilary and michael craig as douglas are rather better, but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film. there is also little in the way of coherent plot, beyond the tale of charles's inexorable downward slide.<br /><br />the main problem with the film, however, is neither the acting nor the plot, but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name. there are half-hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and hilary, or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part, and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. unfortunately, even in the swinging sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970) there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow, and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off-limits. (the american title for the film was 'brotherly love', but this was not used in britain; was it too suggestive for the liking of the bbfc?) these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates charles or what has caused his moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre. 4/10this movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured. there's male full frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, the female loosing control of her bladder. all shot in a gray cold color. effective, but a little too much. we then move on to seeing the btk killer's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes. the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it's creepy. here we don't see fancy or good imagery, it looks as if shot with your home camera. it doesn't look horrifying, but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling. what this movie doesn't have is any drama, really. there are some cop scenes every once in a while, but there's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer. there isn't much of an arc to this story. this could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. unfortunately, the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage. it's dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again. sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look away. and that i have to reject. i'm all for low budget horror movies but i don't tolerate animal suffering. it was unnecessary, excessive, and comes without warning. i'm glad that lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does, but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore. stay away from this garbage.back in the day, i remembered seeing dumb nintendo power comics that had the same artwork as this show... and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me! i was not estatic, but curious... i was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck. my friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy (i'm actually gay), so i decided to watch the show with low expectations.<br /><br />what a horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!! first off, i hate the new characters. tiff and tuff are so dumb and i hate how so many fanboys drool over tiff, it's sad. i also hate how they made chef kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. bad move, 4kids tv! escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the king dedede (who sucks big time in this show) and i hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying dedede with those awful weapons to destroy kirby. so stupid, i hate this show.<br /><br />i then began to hate kirby even more since it was obvious nintendo was just aching to get kirby some popularity. kirby'll never beat mario in the fight for coolness, and kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness. nuf said!!!this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest, in my opinion. a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. and at this point, i will say that these films are not real! they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible.<br /><br />the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases. for example, when they kick the girl in the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl! and how stupid this looks! the sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense. other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, the ripping off of fingernails, worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that. very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant. this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, flowers of flesh and blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible.<br /><br />guinea pig: devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is. this is still (of course) faked s(n/t)uff, the only difference to genuine \"snuff film\" is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film. i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive. they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it. i watched this as a curiosity (as the other parts in the series) and now i know how insignificant trash these are. they work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement. devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest film i've seen and mermaid in a manhole (guinea pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting film i've seen. so these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.of all the movies i have seen, and that's most of them, this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the u.s. naval airships (blimps) during the ww-ii era. yes there are other good lta related movies, but most use special effects more than any real-time shots. this man's navy has considerably more real-time footage of blimps etc. true, lots of corny dialog but that's what makes more interesting hollywood movies, even today. p.s. i spent 10 years(out of 20) and have over 5,000 hours in navy airships of all types, from 1949 through 1959. proud member of the naval airship association etc. [atc(la/ac) usn retired]terrfic film with a slightyly slow start - give it a chance to start cooking. story builds in interest and complexity. characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments. superb new york city locations - gritty, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of \"sex in the city\" - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to the hbo/hollywood notion of new york city , sex and relationships. it's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. loved it! great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi, rosario dawson, and her love interest (forgot his name!).who would've imagined -- hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. the fusion is highly entertaining.<br /><br />having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade, i approached this one with some caution. his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. the director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of long island, new york or in new york city itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a \"spy thriller\". to my pleasant surprise, hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. it works in more ways than one might imagine. hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.<br /><br />moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana. truly he is coming into his own. the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley's vision and style. fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before.i feel blessed to own what is known as the worst steven seagal movie ever made. i knew i was on to something special when steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. by the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and i was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter.<br /><br />steven is steven (with an ever changing voice) and totally unbelievable in his role (as always). who the hell lets people with bad nappy-hair pony tail mullets into the forces anyway? he also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior. the supporting actors all look like they've been shot in the dark - btw, did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting? <br /><br />this is truly abominable in every way possible. invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this one's truly special.maybe i'm biased to foxes, fox stories and all but i thought this was wonderfully done.<br /><br />i really enjoyed that it was shown when lily wasn't comfortable, such as the fire and the room (trying not to spoil too much here). i think that's important for kids to see and try to understand.<br /><br />after reading a few others comments i'm a bit confused, one says that at the end -spoiler- the mother and her son appear, as she's been the one telling her son about her story. the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end, merely a painting of a girl with a fox. can someone enlighten me on that? anyway i really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through. still worth it if they can sit still.the tooth fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives. the first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day. the worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting. they could have done without the hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect. the eye candy is pretty good for both genders. camera work is good. dialog is fair but cheesy. i expected the film to be a bare bones, low budget, slasher with very few redeeming factors. i was surprised by the quality of the film.quite average even by monogram standards, this mystery (a remake of the sphinx) has an oddball plot which is not unraveled to much effect -- you'll see through it after about ten minutes. the two leads have some nice breezy dialog at the outset, but john hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain (perfectly cast lionel atwill originated the role) and warren hymer's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying. however, it's worth sitting through for a five-minute appearance by the incomparable mantan moreland as nicodemus the janitor, who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance. you've got to hand it to bill \"one-take\" beaudine; he wasn't much of a director, but he would always punch up a routine programmer with some goofy vaudeville.i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly. it is not even funny. any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it. in the first half hour, rob schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk. all i could think was \"he deserves it, for making such a bad movie\". don't waste your time or money on this one.even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old, i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack nicholson's descent into madness. this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. the twins, the elevator of blood, redrum, the crazy nonsense \"writing\"... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. the film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. and it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.\n"
